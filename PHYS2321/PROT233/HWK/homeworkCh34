Ch. 34  Concept Q.s 1,4,6,8
        Prob.s 1,4,7,8,14,45

CQ 1. Maxwell included a term in Ampere's law to account for the 
contributions to the magnetic field by changing electric fields,
by treating those changing electric fields as "displacement currents".

CQ 4.  List at least 3 differences between sound and light.
       Sound ...
   1) is a longitudinal wave
   2) requires a material medium to travel
   3) has a speed around 100's of meters/second
   4) speed of sound in mediums other than air
      can be faster or slower than in air
   5) Audible sound has frequencies over a 
      range of 3 decades (10 octaves) from
      20 Hz to 20 kHz.
   6) Audible sound has wavelengths of 1.7 cm to 17 m.
   7) Sound involves varying pressure and density
       Light ...
   1) is a transverse wave
   2) doesn't require a material medium
   3) has a speed around 300,000,000 meters/second
   4) speed of light in materials is only slower 
      than in a vacuum
   5) Visible light has frequencies over a 
      range of less than 1 octave from 430 to 700 THz.
   6) Visible light has wavelengths of very small
      size from 400 to 750 nm.
   7) light involves varying electric and magnetic fields

CQ 6.
   a) The E and B fields of the light wave oscillate in time
      at each point in space, like sports fans in a grandstand
      when the crowd does "the wave".
   b) The wave transports energy (and momentum).

CQ 8.  Electromagnetic waves carry momentum.  Recalling Ch. 9, the 
   impulse imparted by a particle that bounces elastically off
   a wall is twice that imparted by an object that sticks to
   the wall.  Similarly, the impulse, and hence the pressure
   exerted by a wave reflecting from a surface must be twice
   that exerted by a wave that is absorbed.

Student Advisory Board "Week Without Homework" Proposal.
<br>
<br>

The faculty were asked to place this general response in
our syllabi and come up with customized responses:
<br>
<br>
"COVID-19 has impacted all aspects of college life. Students, faculty, staff, administrators, and the rest of the Ohio Northern University community all must deal with the ramifications of this traumatic disease. Members of the faculty are offsetting the stress that students have associated with learning during this worldwide crisis. A single solution cannot be easily applied across the entire college. In the interests of fairness and transparency, individual faculty members will include on their syllabi the measures they took to relieve the pressures students are experiencing in their classes, while maintaining the high-quality scholastic interactions required to help students find success in their futures. The only way we will get through this crisis is by communicating with one another, not adding to the pain we have, and by finding middle ground when needed."

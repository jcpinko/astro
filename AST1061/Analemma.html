<div style="text-align: left;"><big>DESCRIPTION:&nbsp; You will
observe the Sun's position
(Altitude and Azimuth) at the same time of day (sticking to standard
time) for about twice per week for at least 3 months.&nbsp; </big><big>You
will record the altitude and azimuth of the Sun
at exactly the same time of day for as many days as possible.&nbsp;
Choose a time to record that is within 2 hours of noon. Once a week
will
probably be a sufficient frequency, but observations should be
sustained over about 3 months.&nbsp; If you have a good method for
measuring the Sun's
position (a makeshift gnomon, or sundial) you will easily notice the
change in
altitude of the Sun as Winter progresses into Spring.&nbsp; But you
will also see a change in azimuth.&nbsp; (This is related to the
"equation of time"; the way the solar day increases and decreases
throughout the year.&nbsp; This in turn, is related to the Earth's
elliptical orbit and its axis tilt.) You will plot your positions
on a graph of altitude and azimuth.&nbsp; An alternative to making
measurements on a piece of paper is to take <span style="font-style: italic;">wide-field</span>
photos. (You will hurt your eyes focusing on a zoomed image of the Sun,
so be careful!!)&nbsp; You must take your pictures with your camera in
the same position - use a tripod.&nbsp; The photos can then be combined
into a composite photo or made into an animation. Try to explain
the way the Sun's noontime position changes in terms of the Earth's orbital
motion and axial tilt.</big><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; State the goals of the project.&nbsp; Briefly summarize the methods and results.<br>
Introduction (100 - 800 words)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of your projects involve checking something that is
already known.&nbsp; Here you can describe what you expect&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to find
based on what you read in textbooks and other references.&nbsp;
Describe the physics and/or geometry of the <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; situation.&nbsp; Some
historical background can be discussed here.&nbsp; (You'll have to do a little research for this section.)<br>
Procedure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Describe how you made your observations.&nbsp; If any

&nbsp;&nbsp; describe
how they were made/acquired and how they were used.<br>
Results<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Include raw data (written in ink or pencil) and neatly tabulated data.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Show sample calculations, as needed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Make graphs and plots, as appropriate, to try to address the goals of the project. <br>
Conclusions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Try to make sense out of you observations.&nbsp; Address any questions I gave you in the project description.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you observe what was expected (as described in the
introduction)?&nbsp; You may not see a clear result because of&nbsp;
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; uncertainties in your measurements, so discuss uncertainties.&nbsp; <br>

<big><br>INSTRUCTIONS:<br>
<br>
You really need a precise way to make the positional measurements of
the Sun.&nbsp; Measuring altitude and azimuth using one's fist at arms
length will not quite be precise enough.&nbsp; In fact, even an
astrolabe will probably not be precise enough, and it will only provide
altitude.&nbsp; So here are some ways to
make better measurements:&nbsp; <br>
1) A board with a stick mounted
perpendicularly to
it.&nbsp; Such a stick is called a "gnomon".&nbsp; Put a piece of paper
on the board such that, when the board is laid flat on the ground, the
shadow of the stick will fall on the paper and can be marked at the
same time every day.&nbsp; (The board + gnomon makes a sundial.) The position of the board, its
levelness, and the gnomon's position have to be repeated closely from
one day to the next.&nbsp; A bubble-level may be useful.&nbsp; Rulers
can be used to measure the height, <span style="font-style: italic;">h</span>, and the length of the shadow, <span style="font-style: italic;">l</span>, so that the altitude will be given by <span style="font-style: italic;">a = tan</span><sup style="font-style: italic;">-1 </sup><span style="font-style: italic;">(h/l)</span>.&nbsp; <br>
2) Use the board and paper from example 1, but instead of making a
stick, find some natural corner on campus (e.g., the edge of a brick
wall, or the corner of a railing) that is permantly fixed to use as the
gnomon.&nbsp; Place the board in the region where the shadow will be at
your measurement times.&nbsp; Discretely mark (with chalk) the edges of
your board so you can repeat its position.&nbsp; Note: if you use
something too tall, (like a flagpole) the shadow will change its
position from January to April so much that it may not fit on the
board.&nbsp; As a rule of thumb, expect the shortest and the longest
shadow to differ in length by about 2/3 of the height of the
"gnomon".&nbsp;&nbsp; A 3-foot high railing would be good. </big><big><br>
3) Use a wide-field digital camera on a tripod.&nbsp;
The tripod foot positions on the ground would have to be marked for
future
use. &nbsp; The direction that the camera is pointing (both altitude
and azimuth) need to stay fixed, as does the zoom on any zoom
lens.&nbsp; Then the Sun will change its position relative to
the fixed scenery and relative to the pixels on your images.&nbsp; The
change in pixel position can be converted into a change in altitude and
azimuth.&nbsp; <span style="color: rgb(248, 6, 13);">Avoid looking through the camera at the Sun</span>
- you can use trial and error to find which pointing position puts the
Sun near the center.&nbsp; (But try to adjust for the fact that the Sun
will be changing its position while the camera stays fixed.)&nbsp;
Later, you can use software to combine all of the images.&nbsp; That is
how pictures like this are made:</big><br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 312px; height: 377px;" src="analemma_vr_big.jpg" alt="The analemma as seen from the Ukraine."><br>
</div>
<big><br>
Of the three previous methods, I think that #2 would be the easiest to
carry out.&nbsp; You can come up with another method, just describe it
well in your procedure.<br>
<br>
You must also know the time precisely and measure at the same time to
within about 1 minute. (The Sun moves about 1/4 degree per minute, but
the Sun's diameter is only 1/2 degree.)&nbsp; So make sure that your
timepiece
does not get too far ahead or behind.&nbsp; This project has been done
photographically before over an entire year by many people (try a
Google <span style="text-decoration: underline;">image</span> search for "analemma").&nbsp; You will only be able to
trace out about 1/4 of this "figure 8" in 3 months.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Notes on log:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since Col 1 (in MM/DD/YY format) is difficult to plot with Excel, make
Col 2 (in Days) out of Cols. 1 and 3.&nbsp; Look at a calendar and
count the days since the start of 2013 (e.g,. Feb 2 is 33 days). The fraction comes from Col 2
(e.g., 21.53 hrs = 0.897
days).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Col 6 &amp; 8,
are the main measurements you make of the Sun.&nbsp; If you use
photographs, you can make your first Alt and Az equal to the <span style="font-style: italic;">Stellarium</span>
values, and then measure all of the other Sun positions relative to
that position.&nbsp; You will need a scaling factor between #pixels on
your digital photo and degrees.&nbsp; This can be found by using your
same camera setup (especially the zoom, if it has one) and taking a
picture of a recognizable constellation at night.&nbsp; Then you can
measure the angular distance between two stars that you can identify on
that picture using <span style="font-style: italic;">Stellarium</span>.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
YOUR REPORT<br>
<br>
Your Introduction should include a description of the Earth's orbital
motion and orbit shape.&nbsp; Also, discuss how the length of the solar
day changes slightly throughout the year.<br>
<br>
Your Procedure should include a photo or simple line drawing of the setup that you used.<br>
<br>Your Results should include a diagram of your analemma.&nbsp; This
is basically a plot of Sun's Altitude vs the Sun's azimuth.&nbsp; Label
some of the points with dates.&nbsp; Draw an extrapolation (a guess) of
what the rest of the analemma would look like. If you used a digital
camera, you can show a composite of all of your pictures in addition to
the plot.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
In your Conclusions, try to include answers to these questions:<br>
1) Was your analemma tilted, as in the above picture, or verticle?&nbsp; Why? How could you have made it verticle?<br>
2) What was happening to the Earth's orbit during the time you recorded
your analemma.&nbsp; Was the day shorter than average or longer than
average?<br>
3) When does the Sun's noontime position change the most from one day to the next?<br>
4) How would you do this differently if you repeated the experiment?<br>

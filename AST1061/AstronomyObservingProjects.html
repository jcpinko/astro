</div>
<br>
<big>General points:<br>
</big>
<ul>
  <li><big>All projects are designed to be done without a telescope.&nbsp;
However, if you really want to use a telescope or binoculars, meet with
me about alternatives (especially if you own your own).&nbsp; </big></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><big>Each person should do their own report.&nbsp; If you are
doing the same project as another person, you can observe together and
discuss the project together, but do not share data or parts of your
papers.</big></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><big>Meet with Dr. Pinkney during office hours if you have questions about your report.</big></li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><big>The project will serve as an artifact to satisfy the general
education tag of Scientific and Quantitative Literacy.  The rubric for
this tag is given in the appendix of

1. The orbital periods of the Moon.<br>Description:&nbsp; You will
observe the Moon's phase and position
(relative to the stars) around the 1st quarter phase of the Moon for at
least two months in a row.&nbsp; You can then measure for yourself the
length of the synodic and sidereal months.&nbsp; The synodic month is
the time between two like phases.&nbsp; The sidereal month is the time
between two passages of the Moon past a given position on the
sky (use right ascension because the Moon will not follow the exact
same path on consecutive months).&nbsp; Therefore, you must note the
precise phase (% illumination)
of the Moon and its position in the sky (plot it on a star map) on the
1st quarter and the 4 days before and after 1st quarter. <br>

2. Variable stars.<br>
Description:&nbsp; You will monitor 2-3 variable stars in the sky and
try to catch them near minima.&nbsp; The best stars are Beta
Lyrae, Algol, and Delta Cephei in the constellations Lyra, Perseus, and
Cepheus, respectively.&nbsp; The first two of these are eclipsing
binary
star systems, while Delta Cephei is a pulsating star.&nbsp; Other
variables can be found through research, but you should check with your
instructor as to whether they will be "doable". &nbsp; You will need to
find published predictions of minima and maxima in order to plan your
observations.&nbsp; You will also need to learn about doing photometry
by eye using finder charts and several comparison stars for each
variable star.<br><a href="./Variables.html">

3. Tracing the Sun's analemma.<br>
Description:&nbsp; You will record the altitude and azimuth of the Sun
at exactly the same time of day for as many days as possible.&nbsp;
Choose a time to record that is within 2 hours of noon. Once a week
will
probably be a sufficient frequency, but observations should be
sustained over about 3 months.&nbsp; If you have a good method for
measuring the Sun's
position (a makeshift gnomon, or sundial) you will easily notice the
change in
altitude of the Sun as Winter progresses into Spring.&nbsp; But you
will also see a change in azimuth.&nbsp; You will plot your positions
on a graph of altitude and azimuth.&nbsp; (If ambitious, you can try to
combine photos into a composite or make an animation.) Try to explain
the way the Sun's position changes in terms of the Earth's orbital
motion and tilt.<br>

4. The motions of planets and comets<br>
Description:&nbsp; You will see for yourself why planets were called
"wandering stars" - they are bright dots that move relative to the
constellations.&nbsp; You will record the positions of two solar system
bodies and try to make sense of their motion over a 2-3 month period.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">For spring 2013,
Jupiter is the obvious choice, although Saturn will be visible before
midnight by mid-February and Mars and Venus are early evening or
morning objects.&nbsp; Also, Comet PANSTARRS (C2011 L4) should reach
naked-eye brightness around March/April.&nbsp;</span> You should begin
by observing the two planets with the best visibility (bright and above
the horizon at a convenient time).&nbsp; If a comet becomes naked-eye
visible, you can drop the planet which is least visible.&nbsp;
Binoculars (stored at the observatory) can greatly improve the
visibility of comets, allowing you to record them even as they have faded from naked-eye view.<br>

5. Weather and the twinkling of stars.<br>
Description:&nbsp; When stars twinkle, it is not something happening
physically to the star, but instead it is related to the
inhomogeneities of the Earth's atmosphere.&nbsp; You will record the
weather conditions for every night (don't use forecasts, only current
conditions) and observe twinkling at least 2 times per week. &nbsp; The
times should not be closer together than about 1 day. &nbsp; Then you
will look for correlations between the amount of twinkling and the
weather.&nbsp; Is twinkling more extreme when the sky is completely
clear or when it is hazy?&nbsp; Does it occur more when temperatures
are high, or low, or when temperatures are climbing or falling?&nbsp; When is twinkling the least noticeable?&nbsp; <br>

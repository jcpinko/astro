The wave period is a
measurement of the amount of time needed for a wave to repeat itself
at some point in space. The wavelength is the distance between any
two consecutive positions in the wave, such as from peak to peak. The
amplitude is the maximum height or depth of the wave above or
below the undisturbed state. The wave frequency is the number of
waves that pass a point per unit of time, usually waves per second.</font></p>

4. Diffraction is the ability
of
waves to bend around corners. A sharp-edged gap in a wall produces a
fuzzy shadow due to dfraction. Diffraction would not occur if
light were strictly made of particles.<br>

6. White light is made up of
all
of the colors (wavelengths) of light between red and violet, a
continuous spectrum.<br>
</p>
<p
 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br>
</p>
8. The electric force is
similar
to the gravitational force in that it drops off by the inverse square
of the distance. It is different in that it can be either attractive
or repulsive; dislike charges attract and like charges
repel. If the number of positive and negative charges are equal in
an object, it appears to be neutral and has no&nbsp; electric
force.
Gravity is always present and is never neutralized.
<p
 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">10.
Light actually consists of
vibrating electric and magnetic fields moving through space.</p>

12. The parts of the
electromagnetic spectrum for which the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere is
transparent are the visible (when it isn&#8217;t cloudy!) parts of the
infrared, and radio waves between about one centimeter to ten meters.</p>

14. Wien&#8217;s Law states that the
wavelength at which a body emits the peak amount of radiation in its
blackbody curve depends inversely on the temperature of the body; no
other factors are involved. By observing the wavelength at which
this peak radiation occurs, the temperature of a star can be
determined.</p>
<p
 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br>
</p>
<p
 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">16.
As the coal cools off, its
temperature decreases. According to Wien&#8217;s Law, more and more of
its radiation will be emitted at longer and longer wavelengths.
According to Stefan&#8217;s Law, it will emit less and less radiation as
it cools. The net result is that it gets fainter and redder with
time.<br>
</p>
<p
 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">
</p>
<p>18. By measuring the
amount of
shift in the wavelength of some form of radiation, astronomers can
determine whether an object is moving towards or away from
us.&nbsp;
The shift is proportional to the
speed. So by measuring the Doppler shift, the velocity can be
determined.</p>
20. Even with clouds,
the
day-night cycle is quite evident. The lunar cycle would be evident
from the light given off by the Moon, although it might not be clear
what the
object is that causes
the lunar cycle. Radio radiation
easily penetrates clouds. Little would be known about stars because
their radiation is mostly at visible&nbsp;
wavelengths.<br>

2. A simple spectroscope is
made
up of a slit, a prism, and an eyepiece or screen. The slit defines a
narrow beam of light. The prism spreads the light out into its
various wavelengths or colors. The eyepiece or screen allows the
spectrum to be observed.<br>
</p>
<p
 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">3.
The spectrum emitted by a
blackbody is known as a continuous spectrum. Light is emitted at all
wavelengths but the amount of light emitted at each wavelength varies
and depends on the temperature of the blackbody. An absorption
spectrum appears like a continuous spectrum but with specific
wavelengths missing. Dark vertical lines or bands, which can be
quite narrow or very broad, are found throughout the spectrum.</p>
<p

 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">
4. Gamma rays carry much more
energy in every photon than radio waves. They carry enough energy to
harm living tissue. In passing through cells, gamma rays can break
up important molecules, such as DNA, and also ionize atoms which then
cause further cellular damage.</p>
<p
 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br>
</p>
<p
 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">
5. A photon is a particle of
light.</p>

 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br>
</p>
<p
 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">
6. Color is usually related to
wavelength, which in turn is dependent on energy; red is the longest
wavelength and violet the shortest wavelength. Since wavelength and
frequency are inversely proportional, red has the lowest frequency
and energy; violet has the highest frequency and energy.<br>
</p>
<p>7. Each orbital has a
precise
energy, like in the Bohr model, but the electron is smeared out in an
electron cloud or probability shell. The exact location of the
electron cannot be determined.</p>
8. The hydrogen atom has one
proton in its nucleus and one electron moving around it. The
electron is found in one of many possible energy levels or orbitals.
<br>
<p
 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">9.
When a physical quantity is
quantized it means that it takes on only specific values rather than
a continuous range of values.</p>
<p
 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br>
</p>
<p
 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">
10. The normal condition for
atoms is one in which the number of electrons equals the number of
protons in the nucleus. The electrons are in their lowest energy
level. When an atom is excited, an electron is found in a higher
energy orbital. The precisely-defined energy states or energy levels
are referred to as orbitals. They are the regions occupied by
electrons that surround the nucleus.</p>
<p
 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br>
</p>
<p
 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">
11. In order for a photon to be
absorbed, it must have an energy that is precisely equal to the
energy difference between two energy levels, the lower level which is
occupied by an electron. The electron absorbs the photon and moves
to the higher energy level. Very quickly thereafter the electron
moves back down to the lower energy level by emitting a photon of
equal energy to the energy difference between the two levels.</p>
<p
 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br>
</p>
<p
 style="margin-left: 0.38in; text-indent: -0.38in; margin-bottom: 0in;">
12. A star produces a
continuous
spectrum. However, this light passes through a cooler layer of gas
that surrounds the star. Specific wavelengths are absorbed by this
gas and the resulting spectrum appears as an absorption spectrum, a
continuous spectrum with specific wavelengths missing. Emission
lines are not normally found in a stellar spectrum because they are
produced in a hot, low density gas. Most stars have a layer of a
cool, low density gas forming an absorption spectrum. However, in
some cases, a hot, low density layer can form or can be found in
clouds of gas between stars and an emission spectrum is seen.&nbsp;
Information about the
composition and temperature of the cool gas, along with its motions,
can be determined from the absorption lines.</p>

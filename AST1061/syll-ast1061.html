http://www.mypearsonstore.com/bookstore/astronomy-today-9780134450278"
>Astronomy Today, 9/E </a> &nbsp; (9th Edition)&nbsp; by Chaisson and McMillan.
This 2017 edition has a "rent-only" ISBN-13 of 978-0134450278. This is what we
have in the bookstore.  Do NOT buy the Volume 1 or 2 versions
("The Solar System" and "Stars and Galaxies").  Cost of rental should
be about $76.  I don't require you to bring the text to class.
<br>
</p>
<p ><b>Course Description:</b>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Stars and Galaxies </span>
is an introductory astronomy course. &nbsp; You will learn about the
nature of stars, galaxies and the universe. The details of our solar system 
are left to PHYS 1051. &nbsp; We will begin with a survey of the
naked-eye universe (mostly nearby objects) and end with cosmology
(the distant universe). &nbsp; In-between we will discuss such topics
as the electromagnetic spectrum, the sunspot cycle, how stars are born
and die, and galaxies. A recurrent theme will be distances and
the <i> distance ladder </i>, a battery of techniques that take us 
from the Earth all the way out to the most distant galaxies. 
A tentative calendar of topics is outlined <a href="#sched">below</a>.
<br>
<br>

Physics 1061 fulfills a general education learning outcome
called 'knowledge of the physical/natural world'. 
<br>
<br>

<!-- 
Thus, you will be encouraged to improve your science knowledge and skills.
Science "skills" include critical thinking, problem solving, use of 
mathematics, observing, and experimentation. 
I hope that it will become second nature for you to ask
"how do they know that?" when presented with facts
like "the age of the universe is 13.8 billion years".
Another course objective is learning how certain physics principles,
like conservation of momentum,
can be applied to astronomical objects like stars and galaxies.
Still another is to see how our astronomy class relates to 
current events in the world around us - you will get extra
credit for reporting astronomy news items in class.
Since this is an introductory course, I will try to make the tests
nearly math-free. But you will still be exposed to math
in homework, lectures and activities.  
-->


<b>Course Objectives: </b> <br>
By the end of this course, students will:
<ul> 
        <li> Obtain knowledge of astronomy 
<!-- to include
     history - the heliocentric revolution
     The Sun and stars
     stellar properties (report on your assigned star) 
     Galaxies 
-->	     
	<li> Recognize some of the laws of physics inherent in astronomy
<!-- such as
    conservation of mass-energy (nuclear fusion in stars)
    conservation of angular momentum formation of stars and galaxies 
    universal gravitation in orbits of planets, stars and galaxies
-->
	<li> Develop scientific skills related to astronomy
<!-- such as
    critical thinking (asking "how do you know that?"), 
    problem solving (homework problems)
    visual observing and object identification (observing forms)
    pattern recognition (constellation sheets).
-->
	<li> Expand their personal cosmology ("theory of everything")
<!-- quantify the relative sizes of ...
     the Earth, solar system, Milky Way Galaxy, superclusters
     of galaxies, and the cosmic microwave background.
-->	     
	<li> Understand the nature of science in general
<!--  how it differs from pseudoscience and other belief systems
      how it uses the scientific method, 
      how it relies on math and statistics.
-->
</ul>

<!---
There are many fascinating stories behind how the (sometimes dry)
facts of astronomy are established. So when you hear or read
some new fact, like the Sun's surface temperature is about 6000 K,
or all of the iron in our bodies came from supernovae,
keep in mind the question "how do you know that?"&nbsp; In fact, that
question is the beginning of critical thinking and should even
be asked of accepted facts, like the spherical shape of the Earth. <br>
-->

<p><b>Lab: </b>
<br>
The lab for this class, PHYS 1091 (1 hr), is designed for 
astronomy minors and physics majors with an astronomy core &nbsp; 
It is not required of PHYS 1061 students.
You'll need my approval to enroll in the lab.  
If you are enrolled, expect an e-mail from me this week about 
choosing the meeting time.  <br>
</p>
<p ><b>Astronomy Minor: </b>
<br>
You might consider being an 
<a href=https://www.onu.edu/academics/astronomy >
astronomy minor  
 </a>
if a good 
familiarity with astronomy would complement your current major.  
Consider entering an exciting field like astrobiology, 
astrochemistry, archeoastronomy, cosmochemistry, science education, 
science illustration, or science journalism.  
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Observatory:</span><br>
Your visits to the
<a href="https://jpastro.net/astro/ONUObservatory.html">ONU
Observatory</a>&nbsp; will weigh into the 
"Observing" portion of your grade (see below).  
<!-- There may be one class period which meets at the 
Observatory to observe the Sun.   -->
You should try to visit at least 3 times for 100%.
There is a legal pad in the control room that you must sign for credit.
I plan to be at the observatory for 1 hour on Friday nights (if &lt 50%
cloudcover) so that I can help you fulfill your observing duties.
Another time to visit is during meetings of the ONU Astronomy Club every 
other Wednesday night at 9 pm.
Still another time is during "Public Events" which  
are held on Friday nights for <b> two </b>  hours.
<!--
In addition, you should try to visit at least 3
more times, for "A" work.  There is a legal pad in the control
room that you must sign to get credit.
Only about 40% of the nights are clear enough to observe, and
the time of sunset gets progressively later.  This is why 
there is no fixed time to visit.  Moreover, I do not open the 
Observatory every night or even every clear night.
Your strategy must be to watch the weather and call the Observatory
on clear nights to see if it is open.  The times I am most likely
to be there are: 1) during Public Events (F nights every 2-3 weeks),
2) during Astronomy Club meetings (every other W around 9 pm), and 
3) during astronomy lab nights (T & R?). <br>

-->
<br>
When you visit, bring along your <b> Constellation Sheets </b>
and <b> observing forms </b> (see below), 
and try to get some views through our telescopes and binoculars.
It is best if you label your constellation sheets
<b> before </b>  going out to the observatory.
I can able to help you with your sheets and forms, although
my attention may be divided.
You can bring a friend or two (not necessarily signed
up in the class) for the long, dark walk to and from the Observatory.  
<!-- However, as campus observatories go, this one is very good (dark site,
well equipped, versatile, ergonomic) and you should take advantage 
of this educational opportunity. -->

<!--
<i style="font-weight: bold;">COVID-19 Safety Plan. </i>
<p><b><i>COVID-19 Safety Plan.</b></i>
ONU updated the
<a href="https://www.onu.edu/sites/default/files/onu-safetyplan-22-9.pdf">Safety Plan for 2021-2022 
</a> in January, 2022.
-->

<!--
The key point is that all students must be masked in class.  Keep the nose
covered, please.  We are not requiring social distancing, but it is still a
good idea to be spread out in our seating.
Let me know if you have to quarantine or isolate
so that I can help you keep up with the class.
</p>
-->

<!--
style="font-weight: bold;">COVID-19 accomodation: </span> </i>
Faculty were asked to include
<a href="https://jpastro.net/covidaccom.html"> this response </a>
to the request from Student Advisory Board to
relieve academic pressure during this time of pandemic.
I choose to <b>drop your lowest homework grade</b>.  Rather than pick
one week that everyone will skip the homework,
I will allow you to pick an especially trying week.  This will appear as a 0
score, but will be dropped from the final grade.
<br><br>
-->

<i style="font-weight: bold;">Moodle</span> </i> 
will be used minimally for this course.  This web page is my LMS! 
I may use Moodle to post your grades by importing them from my spreadsheet.
I may also give a quiz on Moodle if we need to do remote learning or
classes get cancelled.
<br><br>

<i style="font-weight: bold;">Attendance</span> </i>
is important for doing well in this course. &nbsp;
Being absent directly lowers your attendance score -
I will record attendance on some days and 
factor this into your "In-class" grade (see above).
Absenteeism 
indirectly lowers your grade when you miss lecture material or 
in-class activity. Note that in-class activities cannot be
"made up".  Tests can be made up but only if you
let me know in advance (e-mail is good), providing a
<b><i>valid reason</i></b> for your absence. This may be that
your team or musical group is on the road.
<u>If you miss 
because of an emergency, let me know as soon as possible, and
provide proof of the emergency.</u> "Proof" can consist of a signed
note, or a name and phone number of a parent or authority figure who 
knows your situation.
<u>Make up any missed tests <b> before </b> I go over them during
the next class. </u>
<br><br>

<i style="font-weight: bold;">Graded Homework</i> consists primarily of
answering questions and problems from the textbook.  
&nbsp; Homework will be accepted late, but will only receive 50% 
credit if it has already been graded.  Try to turn it in <i> before </i>
an impending absence.  Homework will be
scored on completeness and correctness, but not every question will be
checked. Look for keys posted after your homework is due.
I encourage you to discuss homework with your classmates, but don't 
copy their work verbatim. You may be docked points for this.
<br><br>

<!--
<i><b> Turning in Assignments. </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
I have shared a <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LesomH7jN22OSdhbYcn9_66KpOEAON7l?usp=sharing"> Google Drive folder </a> 
with you to use for turning in assignments.
You should create a subfolder with a name like: Lastname_Firstname.
Most homework assignments should be typed up in Word (.docx) but then
exported to PDF.  Some might involve drawings which should be scanned and then
turned into a PDF file.  The assignment will be annotated to indicate how
your grade was determined.
</span><br><br>
-->

<i><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quizzes</span> </i>will
be given on most non-exam weeks.&nbsp; They will consist
of 5-15 multiple choice/short answer questions.&nbsp; They cover
the assigned reading and especially the material discussed in
class.&nbsp; The exact time and day of the quiz will be announced
in class.  <!-- I may resort to giving some Moodle quizzes to save time 
in class. -->  (They will not always be given on the same day shown
on the calendar.)
&nbsp; You can only make up a quiz that was missed because of a 
valid conflict or emergency.&nbsp; 
Also, you can only make up the quiz before the
answers are revealed, which is usually the next meeting of the class. 
For this reason, I will drop your lowest quiz score.
<br><br>

<i><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exams</span> </i>
will be given roughly every 4-5 weeks.  These will weigh most
heavily towards your class grade. The <b> final exam </b> will be 
comprehensive, but will emphasize the last 3-4 weeks of material.
The final will occur on Friday of finals week.
<i> Do not schedule anything to conflict with your final exam!
Do not ask to get out of this time! </i>  Drop NOW if this will
be a problem.

<i><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Review Questions</span> </i>
will be provided to help you prepare for quizzes and exams.
They will appear under "NEW STUFF".  Many of these questions
will appear on the quizzes and exams and so it is strongly
recommended that you use them to prepare.  More than half of 
the questions on a given test will be found in the review. 
<br><br>

<i><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Observing</span> </i>
consists of filling out <b> constellation sheets </b>,
<b> Observing Forms </b>,  and visiting the ONU Observatory.
I'll provide you with one hardcopy of the constellation sheets
(aka sky maps).  If you loose them, you can print out more from
<a href="https://jpastro.net/AST1061/ConstSheetsSandG.pdf">SkyMaps.pdf</a>,
which is a PDF file containing 2 sky maps (North and South) for 2 dates 
during the spring (4 sheets total).  <br>

Your job is to 1) write the names of the constellations within all of 
the constellation boundaries, 2) label the 6 brightest stars on each sheet,
and 3) fill out this <a href="./ObservingForm.pdf"> Observing Form  </a> on two different occasions in which you
actually viewed the sky.
<!-- put a check only in the constellations that you actually
spotted in the sky. 
-->
 #1 and #2 can be done on your laptop using a
planetarium program (e.g, Stellarium).  
#3 must be done under open skies, but not
necessarily at the ONU Observatory. 
For full observing credit, you must visit the observatory at least 3
times.  Additional visits give you extra credit in
the "Observing" portion of your grade.
You must <u> sign the log </u> near the entrance to the observatory
in order to get credit for a visit. 
The Observing Forms and Constellation Sheets are due on the last
day of class.
<!--  You will choose your project from 
<a href="https://jpastro.net/astro/AstronomyObservingProjects.html">
this list</a> by the end of week 2.
-->
<br>
<br>
<i style="font-weight: bold;">Tutoring</i> is available.
You are welcome to drop by during my office hours, or you can make an 
appointment.  Physics tutoring sessions should occur on Thursday evenings, 
starting at 7:00 PM.  &nbsp; 
<br><br>

<i><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disruptions: </span> </i>
You should ask questions during
class, and talk during group activities, but in general you shouldn't
talk while the professor is talking. Anything that distracts your
teacher or your neighbors is hindering the teaching/learning process.
This includes playing with your phones, laptops or tablets, talking
with neighbors, coming to class late, and leaving class early.
<b> Do NOT use your phones and laptops during class.</b>  If you want
to make a case that you should take notes with your laptop/tablet rather
then traditional paper, come and see me.  
<br><br>

<i style="font-weight: bold;">Academic Misconduct: </i>
In <i> PHYS 1061 </i> (this class), the biggest 
temptation will be to look at another person's work during tests. Do not 
wear caps during quizzes or exams or store information on electronic devices. 
The penalty for cheating is a zero score for the quiz or exam.
See the link to the university's "Academic Honesty" in the table below.

<i><b> ONU Health & Safety </b></i>
In accordance with the University’s COVID-19 safety plan and the
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TxM5pA0mfdMvw-t5dYvaaUGYbarYZfvM/view" >
Polar Pledge </a>, all
students will wear face coverings at all times in academic buildings. Additionally, students
are to maintain a social distance of 6 feet when possible, especially when in conversation
with others, during academic course meetings, and while waiting for a classroom to open.
No eating or drinking will be allowed during course meetings. Students who violate this
policy will be asked to leave the building immediately and must comply with this request.
Additionally, students will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for adjudication.
Students who are unable to wear a face covering will need to make arrangements for
accommodations with the Student Disability Coordinator prior to or during the first week of
classes. ( <a href="https://www.onu.edu/disability-services" >

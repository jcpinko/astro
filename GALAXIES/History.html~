The images on this page were taken by Dr. Pinkney and Monique Aller (U.
Michigan)
at the MDM Observatory in Arizona (see "Technical Information on
Images" link).&nbsp; These data were important to carry out several
funded science programs of the <a
 href="http://www.noao.edu/noao/staff/lauer/nuker.html">Nuker Team</a>,
(PI D. Richstone, U. Michigan). of which Drs. Pinkney and Aller are
members. &nbsp; The programs all involved&nbsp; supermassive black
holes in nearby galaxies.&nbsp;&nbsp; The high resolution imaging and
spectroscopy provided by the Hubble Space Telescope were at the crux of
the proposals.&nbsp; However, ground-based CCD imaging was also
required.&nbsp; We sought to measure
the masses of black holes in the nuclei of galaxies, and then relate
those
masses to global properties of the galaxy (e.g., morphology).&nbsp; <br>
<br>
This page was conceived by Dr. Jason Pinkney (ONU, Dept of Physics and
Astronomy).&nbsp; Since then, Dr. Pinkney has had several enthusiastic
students to work on the page and its many&nbsp; images.&nbsp; These
include (in chronological order): &nbsp; Rachel Brown (Wesleyan
University),&nbsp; Mike Garee (ONU),&nbsp; Brian Sacash (ONU), and Peter Kircher (ONU).&nbsp;
Many hours were spent converting the FITS format CCD images into JPEGs
and constructing the web page.&nbsp; Thank you students!<br>
<br>
Future Plans:&nbsp; the web page will be redone using an image map
instead of a large table of icons.<br>
<br>
<big><span style="font-weight: bold;">We hope that amateur astronomers
and galaxy enthusiasts everywhere discover
this page. It is a payback to the US taxpayer for their indirect
support of
the sciences and, especially black hole research. </span><br

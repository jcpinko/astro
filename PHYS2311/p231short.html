<P>Class time and place:&nbsp; MTRF, 12:00-12:50 pm, Meyer 114 
</P>
<P><B>Lab:</B> <BR>The lab for this class is Physics 234. There are 2
sections, which will be led by Dr. Caragiu and will be attended and
graded by an undergraduate science major. You will have an
information meeting with your instructor on the first week where you
will be assigned your first lab. Your lab class will be populated by
students from Physics 211 as well as Physics 231. You will
occasionally be expected to do more work for your labs than the 211
students because you are more advanced than they. Just humor us.</P>

<P><B>Course Description:</B> <BR>This course is a calculus-based
introduction to the physics of solid bodies. Topics include motion in
1, 2, and 3 dimensions, forces, Newton's laws, energy, momentum, and
rotational motion.  A tentative calendar of topics is outlined <A HREF="#sched">below</A>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>I will try not to grade any &quot;harder&quot; than the
above. However, if the class mean drops below 75, I will grade more
leniently. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3><B>Course Policies</B></FONT></P>
<P><I>Attendance </I>will be taken and may become a small part (e.g.,
2%) of your final grade.&nbsp; Of course, absenteeism can indirectly
lower your grade as well.&nbsp; Let me know in advance (e-mail is
good) if you plan to miss for a valid reason (e.g. your team is on
the road, you are sick, you have a family emergency).&nbsp; <U>If you
miss a quiz or exam because of an emergency, let me know as soon as
possible, and provide proof of the emergency.</U> 
</P>
<P><I>Homework&nbsp; </I>will mainly consist of working problems from
the textbook.&nbsp; Problem solving is a major part of physics and so
we will use some classtime each week (probably every Friday) for
group work on problem sets. &nbsp; Homework will not be accepted
after it has been graded. If you foresee yourself missing a deadline
because of an excusable absence, again, let me know ahead of time. 
</P>
<P><I>Quizzes </I>will be given on non-exam weeks.&nbsp; They will
consist of about 10 multiple choice/short answer questions.&nbsp;
They cover the assigned reading and especially the material discussed
in class.&nbsp; You can only make up a quiz that was missed because
of a valid conflict or emergency.&nbsp; Also, you can only make up
the quiz before the answers are revealed (usually the next period).
For this reason, I will drop your lowest quiz score. 
</P>
<P><I>Exams </I>will be given roughly every 3 weeks. These will
weight most heavily towards your class grade. The final exam will be
comprehensive, but will emphasize the last 3 weeks of material.</P>
<P><I>Disruptions.&nbsp;</I> You can ask questions during class and
even laugh like a donkey when I tell a joke, but don't interfere with
the learning of the students around you.&nbsp; Class begins at 12:00
PM.&nbsp; Don't be late or you may face public humiliation. You might
also miss a quiz.&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, do not disrupt the class or
you may be asked to leave. 
</P>
<P><I>Cheating</I> will not be tolerated. During tests, do not use
outside references like laptops, calculators, or notes UNLESS I
explicitly allow them. Do not look at another person's quiz or exam
while you are taking one. Also, if you suspect someone is copying
your answers, try to prevent it by moving or shielding your answers.
The penalty for cheating is a zero score for the quiz or exam.</P>
<P><I>Calculators</I>. I encourage you to use a calculator in this
class. However, I will not allow fancy graphing or programmable
calculators to be used during tests and quizzes. Leave the high-end
electronics at home on test days, and try to bring a simpler
calculator for the occasional messy arithmetic. 
</P>
<P><I>Tutoring</I> is available from different sources. First, you
are welcome to drop by during my office hours. Second, there will be
upper level science students (especially physics majors) that will
offer their services. And third, there is a hired science tutor in
Engineering and in Physics (Arts and Sciences) that will be available
(on Thursday evenings, I believe).</P>

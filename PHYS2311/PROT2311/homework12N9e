CQ2 a) The copper's temperature drops and the water
      temperature rises until both temps are the same.
    b) The wter and copper are in thermal equilibrium when
       their temps are the same.
CQ3 a) PV=nRT predicts V going to zero as T goes to zero
    b) The ideal-gas model does not apply when the material
       gets close to liquefaction and then turns into a liquid
       or solid.  The molecules start to interact all the time,
       not just in brief collisions. The molecules start to 
  	make up a significant portion of the volume of the container.
CQ9 Two objects in thermal equilibrium need not be in contact. Consider
 the two objects that are in thermal equilibrium in Figure 16.1(c). The
 act of separating them by a small distance does not affect how the
 molecules are moving inside either object, so they will still be in
 thermal equilibrium.

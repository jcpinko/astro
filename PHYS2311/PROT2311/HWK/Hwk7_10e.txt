Serway and Jewett 10th Ed.
Ch. 8 P. 1,2,3,7,8,10,11,12,16,18,21 
   
1. a) Delta K + Delta U = 0
      leads to v = sqrt(2gh)
   b) Delta K = Wg
      also leads to v = sqrt(2gh)
2.  a) 1st ball: y_f = 1.85E+4 m
       2nd ball: y_f = 5.10E+4 m
    b) E_mech = 1.0E+7 J
3. a) v_B = 5.94 m/s
      v_C = 7.67 m/s
   b) W = 147 J
7. a) W_g = -168 J
   b) Delta E_int = 184 J
   c) W_F = 500 J
   d) Delta K = 148 J
   e) v_f = 5.65 m/s
8. a) W = 650 J
   b) Delta E_int = 588 J
   c) W_n = 0
   d) W_g = 0
   e) Delta K = 62.0 J
   f) v_f = 1.76 m/s
10. a) v_B = 1.65 m/s
    b) The red bead slides a greater distance along the curved path, so
       friction transforms more of the mechanical energy of the system
       into internal energy. There is less kinetic energy when the bead
       arrives at point B.  The result is that the green bead arrives 
       at point B first and at a higher speed.
11. a) U_f = 22.0 J,  E_mech = 40.0 J
    b) Yes, if the potential energy is less than 22.0 J.
    c) If the potential energy is 5.0 J, the total mechanical energy
       is E=K+U=18.0 J + 5.0 J = 23.0 J.  This is less than the original
       40.0 J.  The total mech energy has decreased, so a non-conservative
       force must have acted.
12. a) x = 0.381 m
    b) x = 0.371 m
    c) x = 0.143 m
16. a) Pav = 8.01 W
    b) Some of the energy transferring into the system of the train goes
       into internal energy in warmer track and moving parts and some
       leaves the system by sound.  To account for this as well as the
       stated increase in KE, energy must be transferred at a higher rate
       than 8.01 W.
18. The power of the sports car is 4x that of the older-model car.
21. a) walking fuel economy is 423 mi/gal
    b) bicycling fuel economy is 776 mi/gal

\begin{enumerate}
\item (2) The standard kilogram is a platinum-iridium cylinder
39.0 mm in height and 39.0 mm in diamter.  What is the
density of the material?

\item (7) Which of the following equations are dimensionally
correct?

\begin{enumerate}
\item $v_f = v_i + ax$ \qquad 
(b) $y = (2m) \cos (kx)$ where $k=2$ m$^{-1}$.
\end{enumerate}

% \item (8) Figure P1.8 shows a {\it frustum of a cone}.  
% Of the following mensuration (geometrical) expressions, which describes
% (i) the total circumference of the flat circular faces, \\
% (ii) the volume, and \\
% (iii) the area of the curved surface?

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item $\pi (r_1 +r_2) [h^2 +(r_2 - r_1)^2]^{\frac{1}{2}}$
% \item $2\pi (r_1 + r_2)$
% \item $\pi h(r_1^2 +r_1r_2 + r_2^2)/3 $
% \end{enumerate}

\item What are the dimensions of $\rho v^2$?  (Here, $\rho$ is
density measured in kg/m$^3$, and $v$ is speed.)

\item What are the units of kinetic energy, k, in the MKS system?
(k= 1/2 mv$^2$.  Use only base units not a derived unit.)

\item (10) Suppose your hair grows at the rate $\frac{1}{32}$ in.\ per day.
Find the rate in which it grows in nanometers per second.  Because the distance
between atoms in a molecule is on the order of 0.1 nm, your answer suggests 
how rapidly layers of atoms are assembled in this protein synthesis.

\item (14) Assume it takes 7.00 min to fill a 30.0-gal gasoline tank.
(a) Calculate the rate at which the tank is filled in gallons per second.
(b) Calculate the rate at which the tank is filled in cubic meters per
second.  (c) Determine the time interval, in hours, required to fill a
1.00-m$^3$ volume at the same rate.  (1 U.S. gal = 231 in.$^3$).

\item (21) One gallon of paint (volume = 3.78$\times 10^{-3}$ m$^{3}$)
covers an area of 25.0 m$^2$.  What is the thickness of the fresh
paint on the wall?

% \item (25) Find the order of magnitude of the number of table-tennis
% balls that would fit into a typical-size room (without being crushed).
% In your solution, state the quantities you measure or estimate and
% the values you take for them.

% \item (26) An automobile tire is rated to last for 50,000 miles.
% To an order of magnitude through how many revolutions will it turn?
% In your solution, state the quantities you measure or estimate
% and the values you take for them.

% \item (30) A rectangular plate has a length of (21.3$\pm$ 0.2) cm and
% a width of (9.8$\pm 0.1$) cm.  Calculate the area of the plate, 
% including its uncertainty.

\item (31) How many significant figures are in the following numbers?
\begin{enumerate}
\item 78.9 $\pm$ 0.2 \qquad (b) 3.788 $\times 10^9$ 
\qquad (c) 2.46 $\times 10^{-6}$ 
\qquad (d) 0.0053
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

% {EXTRA CREDIT (1pt):}  What are the dimensions of acceleration?

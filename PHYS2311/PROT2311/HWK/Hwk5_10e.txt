   Serway and Jewett 10th Ed.
   Ch. 6 P. 1,2,4,10,12,14,31
   
1. a) 8.33e-8 N inward
   b) a_c = 9.15e+22 m/s^2 inward
2. a) 1650 m/s
   b) 6850 sec
4.  F_tot = 215 N horizontally inward
10.a) v=4.81 m/s^2
   b) 700 N
12. a) T=20.6 N
    b) a_r = 32 m/s^2 inward
       a_t = 3.35 m/s^2 down (tangent to circle)
    c) a = 32.2 m/s^2 inward and below the cord at 5.98 deg
    d) no change
    e) If the object is swinging down it is gaining speed,
       and if the object is swinging up it is losing speed,
       but the forces are the same; therefore, its
       acceleration is regardless of the direction of swing.
14. a) a=3.6 m/s^2 to right
    b) T=0
    c) Someone in the care (noninertial observer) claims
       that the forces on the mass along x and T and a
       fictitious force (-Ma).
    d) Someone at rest outside the car (inertial observer)
       claims that T is the only force on M in the x
       direction.
31. a) Gravity (mg) downward and Tension towards center of path
    b) free-body diagrams should show that the tension on the
       ball at top of circle is less than at the bottom of the
       circle, while F_g stays the same length.
    c) T=6.05 N
    d) v=7.82 m/s

Please grade #10 and #31. (No more than 2 pts off on each.)

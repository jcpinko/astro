1.a) Toaster takes in E from electrical transmission,
     increases its E_int, sends heat and EM radiation
     into surroundings.
     Thus,   Delta E_int = Q + T_ET + T_ER
  b) Car takes in energy by mass transfer (T_MT) which 
     boosts its chemical potential energy (U), KE increases
     it gives out heat in exhaust and does work on the air
     as it moves, and produces some sound.
     Thus,   Delt K + Delt U + Delt E_int = W + Q + T_MW + T_MT
  c) Similarly,  Delt U = Q + T_MT
  d) Similarly,  0 = Q + T_MT + T_ET + T_ER
5. v = sqrt(3.0gR)
   n = 0.098 N downwards
6. a) 5.94 m/s at B, 7.67 m/s at C
   b) 147 J
13. d = (v^2)/(2*mu_k*g)
14. a) 650 J
    b) 588 J
    c) 0
    d) 0
    e) 62.0 J
    f) 1.76 m/s
15. a) 0.791 m/s    
     b) 0.531 m/s
18. a) v_B = 1.65 m/s
    b) the green bead arrives at B with a higher speed 
       because it travels the shorter path length and 
       therefore looses more mechan energy to friction.
20. a) U_f=22.0 J, E=40.0 J
    b) Yes, DeltaE_mech = Delta K + DeltaU is not equal to zero,
	so some non-conservative force must act.  
22. 3.74 m/s
23. a) -160 J
29. 1.23 kW
30.  Badly phrased problem. 
     Take literally, the answers are a)  P_min = 0 W
     and b) because the minimum speed is 0 m/s.
     They really want you to find the *average* power.  
     This gives:   a) 8.01 W
     This is a minimum because b) there would also be
     energy lost to friction, mechanical resistance, and sound.
38. a) 5910 W
    b) P=11,100 W   (or 14.9 hp)

Please check #15, and #29.  No more than 2 pts off
per problem. -1/2 pt for omitting a problem.

Please alphabetize these homeworks.

Thanks mucho!!

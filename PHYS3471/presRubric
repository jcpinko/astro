Astrophysics presentations       2018-> 2020

This guide supersedes the example PPT on Pluto provided
on the course web page, and previous statements by Pinkney.

TIME
I now want you to shoot for a *little* longer presentation
than 10 minutes.  Acceptable presentation times are 9-16
minutes, with the ideal about 13.  This time does not include 
the ~5 minutes after the talk for asking questions.

QUESTIONS AT END OF PPT
Instead of writing questions to motivate discussion
(like the example PPT), I'd like you to write two exam-style
questions on the last slide of your PPT. See 
"Fielding questions" under "My areas of evaluation".

PARTICIPATION
Everyone should ask at least 1 question during
at least one of the other presentations.  Looking at 
phones and laptops or skipping class without a good 
excuse will give you a deduction.

(DOUBLE) STANDARD
Your professor (me) does not set a high standard for
giving PPT presentations.  All my prep time is spent
in reviewing material, class logistics/grading,
and choosing material to present, with little time for actual 
practice.  You should practice your talk in 
order to fit a topic which deserves an hour into a 
10-15 minute time slot.

PROVIDE PDF
Please email to me your presentation in PDF format
before Monday of finals week.
If the PDF has overlapping text or figures, you
may need to send the PPT as well.

Astrophysics presentations       2022

TIME
I want you to shoot to make your presentation run for a 
little longer than 10 minutes.  Acceptable presentation times 
are 10-16 minutes, with the ideal about 13.  This time does 
not include the ~5 minutes after the talk for asking questions.

QUESTIONS AT END OF PPT
Instead of writing questions to motivate discussion
(like the example PPT), I'd like you to write two exam-style
questions on the last slide of your PPT. See 
"Fielding questions" under "Categories of evaluation" below.

PARTICIPATION
Everyone should ask at least 1 question during
at least one of the other presentations.  Looking at 
phones and laptops or skipping class without a good 
excuse will give you a deduction.

(DOUBLE) STANDARD
Your professor (me) may not set a very high standard for
giving PPT presentations, but I'd like you to practice
your talk in order to fit the (usually large) topic
into a ~15 minute time slot.
  

PROVIDE PDF
Please email to me your presentation in PDF format
before Monday of finals week.
If the PDF has overlapping text or figures, you
may need to send the original PowerPoint as well.

IL:  X-ray spectroscopy of AGN accretion disks

1) Which line is used to most accurately model X-ray emissions?
a) O VIII

a) O VIII
b) C VI
c) Fe K    *
d) N VII

2) TorF:  AGN are more reliable for modeling X-ray
emissions than GBHCs.   
 [True, probably because GBHCs are obscured by our
  galaxy and are not as massive as AGN.]
REVISE:
2) T or F: AGN provide a clearer, more absorption-free view of
relativistically broadened X-ray emission lines than GBHCs.
  [True]

BM:  LIGO and Detection of GWs

1) Why were gravitational waves not detected before aLIGO?
a) Their existence was unknown
B) Gravity is the weakest force   *
c) There was no interest to observe them
d) They were too rare

REVISE:
1) Why were gravitational waves not detected before aLIGO?
a) Their existence was unknown
b) Gravity is the weakest force  
c) There was no interest to observe them
d) They were too rare
E) the sensitivity of GW detectors was too low  *

2) T or F:
GW observations are just like other non-optical EM observations.

[False, the GWs are not affected by absorption, scattering,
and scintillation like EM waves are.]

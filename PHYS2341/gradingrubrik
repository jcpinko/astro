here is that lab grading rubrik that I worked out
with Debbie C and R. Merrill.

Prelab ........ ........................... 2 pts
Answer the questions in the lab manual..... 3 pts (correct & complete)
Error analysis/propogation................. 2 pts
Missing units.............................. 2 pts
Conclusion................................. 1 pt  
                           Total           10 pts

The points column represents the maximum points that can
be taken off for that category.

Other possible reasons to deduct:
	messiness
        not fixing problems that can be fixed (e.g. measurement blunders)
        incorrect calculations
        Writing reflects understanding

Note: I encourage students to express
the difference between the accepted value and their
measurement in terms of "sigma's".  #sigmas = (x_obs - x_accepted)/sigma
where "sigma" is the error in x_obs.  A difference
of less than 2 sigma is good.  If they have a 4 sigma or
larger difference, they probably did something very WRONG.
I discourage students to give the "percentage error"
because it is usually meaningless.  
%error = (x_obs - x_accepted)/x_accepted

Dear Debbie,

here is the grading rubrik that I used previously
with Debbie C. and Robbie.

Prelab ........ ........................... 2 pts
Answer the questions in the lab manual..... 3 pts 
    - correctness & completeness
    - writing should reflect good understanding
Error analysis/propogation................. 2 pts
    - thoroughness
Missing units.............................. 2 pts
Conclusion................................. 1 pt  
    - writing should reflect good understanding
                           Total           10 pts

The points column represents the *maximum* points that can
be deducted for that category.

You can deduct points for other reasons as well.  Just
try to be fair and consistent. Other possible reasons to 
deduct up to 1 pt:
        messiness
        not fixing problems that can be fixed (e.g. measurement 
          blunders, claiming "human error")
        incorrect calculations (in addition to mistakes in "Answer
	  the questions in the lab manual" above)

You can correct grammar and spelling, but let's not get
into deductions for these.

I encourage students to express the difference between the 
accepted value and their measurement in terms of "sigma's".  
Here,  the #sigmas = (x_obs - x_accepted)/sigma
where "sigma" is the error in x_obs.  A difference
of less than 2 sigma is good.  If they have a 4 sigma or
larger difference, they probably did something WRONG.
I discourage students to give the "percentage error"
because it is usually meaningless.  
%error = (x_obs - x_accepted)/x_accepted

cheers,
Dr. Pinkney

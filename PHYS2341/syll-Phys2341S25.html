<p><b>Course Description:</b>
<br>
This is the lab associated with Physics 2311 (Physics I)
and Physics 2111 (General Physics 1).  The student will
perform experiments in Newtonian mechanics (projectile
motion, collisions, conservation of energy, etc), 
Oscillatory motion (the pendulum), and thermodynamics
(specific heat, thermal expansion).
</p>

<p><b>Prerequisites:</b>
You should, ideally, be taking PHYS 2311 (or PHYS 2111) concurrently
with this lab.  It is also acceptable to
have already taken PHYS 2311 (or PHYS 2111).
<br>
</p>

<p><b>Course Objectives:</b>
At the end of the course, students will be able to:
<ul>

<li> Use the scientific method of inquiry in order to complete data collection, analysis, and interpretation.  </li>
<li> Apply principles of Newtonian mechanics, oscillations and thermodynamics to explain natural physical processes such as freefall, collisions, pendulums, thermal expansion and heat transfer. </li>
<li> Understand the procedure and instructions to carry out the experiments. </li>
<li> Use the appropriate physical principles, mathematics, and error propagation to analyze data.</li>
<li> Quantify uncertainties in measurements using instrumental resolution, standard deviation, fractional errors, and fractional discrepancies.</li>
<li> Interpret and communicate the results of the data analysis.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Lab Manual and paper:</b> You need to buy the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
orange</span> manual
"Experiments in Mechanics, Waves, and Thermodynamics", the Physics I lab manual, 
for $15.  We will provide you with the paper needed to write up your lab 
report .  Buy your lab manual from the instructor on the 
first day of class so that you can prepare for the Experiment 1 on week 2.  
<!--
for $13.  You will also need to get a quad-ruled notebook for writing up
your labs.  We sell the notebooks for $2 although you can buy one elsewhere.
Buy your lab manual and notebook ($15 total) from the instructor on the 
first day of class.  
-->
Bring cash, preferably exact change.
If that fails, then find Dr Pinkney during his office hours
in SciAnx 111 before the week 2 lab meeting.

<p><b>Grading:</b><br>
&nbsp;
Your final letter grade is determined based on the average of
your lab report scores.&nbsp; Each lab is scored out of 10 points.
The scores are determined by your TA with
guidance (a rubric) from your instructor.&nbsp; 
The instructor will take the scores from the TA and convert them
into a grade. Typically, 90% and up is an A and 80-90% is a B.  
However, if the class mean is very high compared to other sections, the
instructor may adjust the A-B cutoff.  Usually, if any change is
made, the cutoff is lowered to 89 or 88.  But the cut-off could be
raised to 91 or even 92% in order to keep different sections
consistent. 
<br>
Here is a 
<a href="./gradingrubweb.txt"> rubric  </a>
showing deductions for problems with lab reports.
<br>
</p>
<p><b><font size="+0">Course Policies</font></b>
</p>
<p><i>Attendance</i>&nbsp; is essential for labs.&nbsp; If you miss a
lab completely you get a 0 for that particular lab.&nbsp; If you
miss and have a valid excuse (emergencies, sports or music activities, 
illness) let me know, and I will try to set you up to attend another 
section of the lab.  If that doesn't work out, I may be able to arrange
to let you into the lab at non-lab times.  You have to work more
independently when doing a make-up lab.  There are 5 other
sections of this lab to allow for these make-ups.
</p>
<!-- ... we can try to find another lab section for you to work in 
to make up the lab.&nbsp; This must be okayed by the instructor of the
other lab and you must make sure that you get your completed lab to 
your regular TA on time.<br>
You may NOT regularly attend a lab other than the one you are signed
up for. (Try to transfer early on if another section is preferred.)
-->
<p><i>Tardiness </i>&nbsp; should be avoided. &nbsp; I will deduct 0.5
points from your lab score for every 5 minutes you are late.  It is
important that you listen to the instructions (some of which involve
your safety) given at the beginning of lab.
</p>
<p><i>Sides A and B </i>. We will be dividing our 
lab into 2, roughly equal sides.  This is because we don't have
enough lab apparatuses for 6-8 teams of students for a few labs.  
For most weeks, everyone will do the same lab, but on
the 6th week, side A will do experiment 5 and side B will do
experiment 6.  The following week, side A will do 6 and side B
will do 5.  (See the Schedule below.) The class may need to
split again on weeks 14-15.

<p><i>Lab Time </i>. 
Work in groups of 3, if possible.  The class size and number
of apparatuses may require a group size of 2 or 4.
Use the lab time to gather good data and write up the report.  
If you need more time for the report, arrange with your TA
and instructor to turn it in a day or two later.
Your report is left in the lab (on a bookshelf) for your TA to
find and grade.
<!--
While doing labs in teams of 2, maintain a 6 ft separation by
having one person use a computer to produce the plots and data tables
for their group, while the other person has direct contact with the 
equipment.  You can alternate roles from one week to the next.
-->
</p>

<p><i>Calculators</i>. I encourage you to have a calculator in this lab.
</p>
<p><i>Food and drink</i>. Please do not bring food and drink into the
lab.  I want to avoid trash, clutter, and spills on the keyboards and lab equipment.
A bottled drink that is stored in your backpack is acceptable.
</p>

<!--
<p><i>Special Accomodations</i>. 
Students requiring particular accommodations because of physical and/or learning disabilities should contact the Student Disability Coordinator prior to or during the first week of classes. For additional information, see: 
<a href="https://www.onu.edu/disability-services">
www.onu.edu/disability-services</a>
</p>
-->

<!--
<p><i>ONU Health & Safety.</i>
We will be conforming to ONU's Fall, 2022 COVID-19
<a href="https://www.onu.edu/covid-19-implementation-plan">Safety Plan.
</a>
Masks and social distancing are not mandatory across the board, but
individual classes may require them based on student or instructor needs.
Please have a mask on hand.  If you think you may have a virus that spreads
by respiration, wear a mask to be safe until you get tested.  (Contact 
tracing is continuing and this may be required of you.)
In this lab, you will be working in close quarters with others so
you are encouraged to wear a mask.  We are not requiring social distancing, 
but it is still a good idea to be spread out when you can.
Let me know if you have to quarantine or isolate
so that I can help you keep up with the class.
</p>

<!--
<p><i>ONU Health and Safety Policy</i>. 
In accordance with the University’s COVID-19 safety plan and the Polar Pledge, all students will wear face coverings at all times in academic buildings.  Additionally, students are to maintain a social distance of 6 feet when possible, especially when in conversation with others, during academic course meetings, and while waiting for a classroom to open. No eating or drinking will be allowed during course meetings. Students who violate this policy will be asked to leave the building immediately and must comply with this request. Additionally, students will be reported to the
Office of Student Conduct for adjudication. Students who are unable to wear a face covering will need to make arrangements for accommodations with the Student Disability Coordinator prior to or during the first week of classes.

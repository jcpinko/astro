<br>
Friday, Sept 8, 8:30-10:30 pm. -- Public Event. "Saturn puts on a show" <br>
<br>
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 8:30-10:30 pm this Friday, September 8, for the first public
event of Fall 2023.  The event is called "Saturn puts on a show" because
Saturn has just passed opposition on Sept 27.  This means that it is
relatively close to the Earth and looks big and bright in telescopes.
Planets in opposition also rise right around sunset and stay
up most of the night.  Saturn will be just 10 degrees above the horizon
at 8:30, when we open, but it will only get higher and better over the
next 2 hours.  We will also point our telescopes at other deep sky objects.
One, the "Saturn Nebula", is only about 19 degrees away from the actual planet
Saturn on this night.

<br>
Friday, Sept 22, 8:30-10:30 pm. -- Public Event. "The Autumnal Equinox" <br>
<br>
<div class="mynote">
	ONU and surrounding communities are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
	between 8:30 and 10:30 pm this Friday, September 22 for an autumnal equinox 
	star party!  The autumnal equinox is the start of fall and it officially
	happens on September 23 at 2:50 am Eastern this year.  It is called an
	"equinox" because the length of the daytime hours are about equal to the 
	length of the nighttime hours.  This also happens to be a few days after
	the opposition of Neptune, so it will be optimized for telescopic viewing.
	Finally, Saturn and the 1st quarter Moon will appear truly impressive
	in the eyepiece!

Friday, Oct 13, 8:00-10:00 pm.&nbsp; -- Public Event.&nbsp;
"Eclipse Eve Viewing" <br>
<br>
<div class="mynote">
	Hardin County and surrounding communities are invited to drop by the ONU
	Observatory between 8:00 and 10:00 pm this Friday, October 13 for a 
	"star party".  Friday is the eve of the Annular Solar Eclipse (October 14).  
        Dr. Pinkney will hold a question and answer session about eclipses at
	9:00 pm.  
	This whole event is contingent on the weather; we need less than 50%
	cloudcover to see the skies reasonably well.  As of 10/9/23, the forecast
	is not looking too good for either Friday or Saturday.
	<br>
</div>
<div class="cancel">

	<br>
Saturday, Oct 14, 12:30-1:30 pm.&nbsp; -- STREAMED Event.&nbsp;
"Annular Solar Eclipse" <br>
	<br>
<div class="mynote">
        Dr. Pinkney would like to stream live video and images the Annular
	Solar Eclipse on Saturday between noon and 2 pm.  The Sun will only be
	about 38% obscured as seen from Ada, however, our solar telescopes will
	reveal things like sunspots and prominances which cannot normally be seen
	with eclipse glasses.  Maximum obscuration for Ada occurs around 1:05 pm.<br>

	WARNING: IT IS UNSAFE TO STARE DIRECTLY AT AN ANNULAR ECLIPSE AT ANY TIME 
	DURING THE EVENT. One needs protective eclipse glasses or a pinhole camera
	box to view the bright photosphere of the Sun.
	<br>
	I will post below a link to the live stream on Saturday, but only if the 
	cloudcover is expected to be less than 40%.

Friday, Nov 3, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Jupiter at its closest" <br>
<div class="mynote">
	ONU and surrounding communities are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
	between 8:00 and 10:00 pm this Friday, November 3 for our "Jupiter at
	its closest" event.  The title refers to the opposition of Jupiter, which
	occurs on this date.   Opposition is when the planet reaches 
	its maximum angle away from the Sun (up to 180 degrees).  This happens 
	a day or two after Earth's closest approach to Jupiter, thus making 
	Jupiter appear big and bright in telescopes around opposition and the 
	weeks to follow. <br>
	<br>
	As of Nov 2, the forecast looks to be very cloudy on Friday night.
</div>
<div class="cancel">
	This event is cancelled due to the weather (clouds expected).

<br>
Friday, Nov 17, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Leonid Meteor Shower"
<br>

<div class="mynote">
The final public event this fall at the ONU Observatory celebrates the Taurid Meteor
Shower.  Meteors are streaks of light in the sky caused by small particles
flying into the atmosphere at high speeds.  Most of the particles originate in the
tails of comets.  The peak of about 15 meteors per hour
is expected on the night of Nov 17-18.  In previous years, there were meteor "storms"
which occurred every 33 years, including 1966 and 1999.
One sees the most meteors by just gazing at the sky without a telescope. But we will have
our telescopes pointed at targets like Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus (which has just
passed opposition).  The comet C/2023 H2 (Lemmon) may also be accessible.  <br>
<br>
The current weather forecast is not looking good for observing on Friday, with 
over 50% cloudcover.  A final decision on cancellation will be posted here
in red by 2:30 pm on Friday.
</div>
<div class="cancel">
	This event is cancelled due to the weather (clouds expected). <br>
	Try looking for Leonids in your own backyard on Saturday night
	when the forecast calls for clearer skies.

"Comet ZTF close to Earth"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) has been exciting to watch lately, sporting
3 tails and a green hue!  It will be closest to Earth on Feb 1
and was closest to the Sun on January 12, 2023.  The comet will
probably be the brightest of the year and is well placed for
viewing by the northern hemisphere.

<!--  
	due to harsh cold.  Also, the skies
	will probably be hazy and lit up by a nearly full Moon making
	it difficult to see the comet.
Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) will be closest to Earth (~0.25 AU) on
Thurs Feb 2 so it should look big on Feb 3 as well.  The nearly
full Moon will be only 41 degrees away, but the comet will
reach an altitude of 70 degrees and is expected to be ~5.5 mag
so we should be able to see it.  10 km nucleus.  May be brightest
comet of 2023.

Friday, Feb 24, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Explore the waxing crescent Moon"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
	This event is dedicated to observing the Moon.  It will be
	in a "waxing crescent" phase, meaning that the portion of the
	Moon that appears lit is increasing.  It will be 5 days after
	new moon on Friday night and this is a good time to see
	the round lava plane called Mare Crisium and the double crater
	called Messier A and B.  As the Moon get's low in the west, we'll
	point our telescopes at other interesting targets like the planet
	Mars and the Great Orion Nebula.

Friday, Mar 24, 8:30-10:30 pm. -- Public Event.
"Spring Star Party!"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
	The first day of spring in the northern hemisphere, the vernal 
equinox, just happened on March 20.  This is one of the two days in 
the year in which the Sun rises due East and sets due West.  And now
the length of daylight hours is quickly increasing.  To celebrate
the equinox we will be holding a "Spring Star Party" on Friday, March 24.
The waxing crescent Moon will be only 1 degree from Uranus and 6 degrees
from bright Venus.  The Great Orion Nebula and Mars will also be good targets
for our telescopes.
</div>

<!--
(Daylight Savings Time begins Mar 12, so there
 will still be a little twilight at 8:30 pm EDT.)
Have a star party to celebrate the vernal equinox, the start of spring!
The actual moment of equinox is 4 days earlier: 17:24 EDT on Mar 20. 
The Moon will be waning crescent (3.5 d old) passing Venus and Uranus.
Mars will be easily accessible at the Meridian.
I could discuss the way the Sun (and new Moon and Full Moon)
should be close to the celestial equator, rising due east and
setting due west.

"Mercury at Greatest Elongation"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
This Friday's public event celebrates the Greatest Eastern Elongation of 
Mercury.  This is when Mercury reaches its maximum angular separation
from the Sun in the evening sky.  The actual date of maximum is
April 11, but it will be almost as far on April 7.  The maximum
angle for this GEE will be 19.5 degrees.  It is the time when amateur
astronomers like to view Mercury because it is not lost in the glare
of the Sun.   Mercury will quickly get too low to observe so we will
look at other objects like Mars, Venus and the Great Orion Nebula.

Friday, Apr 21, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Galaxies of Spring"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
April is a good month to look for galaxies in the Ohio skies!  
The chance of cloudcover is going down and the temperatures are going up.
More importantly, the North Galactic Pole is well placed in the sky before 
midnight.  This is where many of the nearby galaxies are located, residing 
in the Virgo Cluster and various other groups.  On this night, with the 
Moon just past new, we will point our telescopes at galaxies.  They are
generally faint, so we may also use sensitive cameras to display 
them. The Lyrid meteor shower is also occurring.
</div>
<div class="cancel">
This event is cancelled due to clouds and rain in the forecast. Sorry!

<!--
	One day after new moon - good for finding galaxies. Also mention
	the solar hybrid eclipse that was visible in Australia on 4/20/23.
	Galaxies like M101, M83, and M87 are well placed for viewing,
	along with globular clusters like M3.

"Neptune at its closest"
<!-- Actual date of opposition is 9/16 (UT) -->
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 9:00-11:00 pm this Friday, September 16 for the first astronomy public
event of the Fall season.   Each event is planned around some theme or a 
celestial happening.  
This Friday, September 16, is the date that Neptune will be
at its closest to the Earth.  That is, Neptune will be in opposition.
This is also when a planet looks its biggest and brightest in a telescope.
Neptune is too faint to see with the unaided  eye, but it appears as a blue
dot through our telescopes.  Saturn, will also be well placed for viewing
because it recently passed opposition on August 14.   It is easier to
see features of Saturn, like its moons and its amazing rings!
Come and see these and other wonders of the night sky!

<br>
<br>
The forecast (as of 9/13) is looking good: partly cloudy and warm (68 F).
We will announce any cancellations by Friday, 2:30 pm, just

The Moon's phase is 2 days before new (waning crescent)
so deep sky objects, Saturn, Jupiter would be targets.
Jupiter is in opposition on Sept 26.-->
<!--
<div class="mynote">
All are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 8:00-10:00 pm this Friday, September 23 for the second astronomy public
event of the Fall season.   This Friday is a celebration of the autumnal equinox
or the start of autumn.  This year, the actual moment when the Sun crosses the
celestial equator on its way south is on September 22
(around 9 pm EST).   After this date, the length of nighttime will surpass 
the length of daytime (which is good for skygazing!).
Saturn will make an excellent target for our telescopes.  Jupiter rises a
little later but is even brighter than Saturn.  In fact, it will be at its
brightest on September 26 when it is closest to the Earth (opposition).
<br><br>
The forecast (as of 9/20) calls for mostly cloudy skies (90% overcast)
and cool (53 F) weather.  This is too cloudy to observe.  We will

<!--
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 8:00-10:00 pm this Friday, October 21, for the third public
astronomy event at ONU Observatory for this Fall.
This event is scheduled to coincide with the peak of the Orionid Meteor
Shower.  This is a popular annual meteor shower that emanates from
the constellation Orion.  Meteors (or "falling stars") are bright streaks in
the sky caused by small particles speeding through our atmosphere.  The Orionid meteor
particles originated in Halley's comet. The Orionids are generally
faster and brighter than average.  The rate of meteors will be greater after
midnight when Orion rises, so we will likely only see about 10/hour.
We will also train our telescopes on planets (Jupiter and Saturn) and deep
sky objects.
<br> <br>
The forecast (as of 10/19) is calling for only 10% cloud cover on Friday
and 57 F. If the forecast changes for the worse, a cancellation message
will appear below this text.

"Uranus at Opposition"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 8:00-10:00 pm this Friday, November 11, for the fourth public
astronomy event at ONU Observatory for this Fall.
Q: What's round, green and full of methane gas?  A: Uranus!  Yes, Uranus, the
seventh planet from the Sun is the inspiration for our event this Friday.
It will pass through opposition on November 9th, just a few days earlier.
This is about when the planet is closest to the Earth and appears opposite the
Sun in the sky.  So Uranus tends to look its biggest and brightest in the weeks
around this date.  Still, it is too faint to see with the naked eye so
our telescopes will be needed.  The gibbous Moon, Mars, Saturn and Jupiter
will also be great targets if weather permits!
<br> <br>
The forecast (as of 11/8) is calling for 80% cloud cover on Friday
and 46 F. Unless the forecast improves by Friday at 2:00 pm, a cancellation
message will appear below this text.
</div>

<div class="cancel">
This event was cancelled due to a forecast of cloudcover.
</div>

<!-- Actual date of opposition is 11/9. 11/8 is Full Moon, so 
Moon will rise at 7:30. Uranus will have alt = 32 deg
at 8:00 while the Moon will only be 4.5 deg high.
So Uranus should be observable, but there will be
light pollution as the evening progresses.

Friday, Dec 9, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Opposition of Mars"
<!-- Actual date of opposition is Dec 8.  Moon is Full on 12/7
so Moon will rise a little after Mars. Mars is way above the Cel Eq.
so it is already 35 deg in altitude at 8:00 pm.  The Moon is 23 degrees
below (East of) Mars. -->
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
The ONU Observatory will be open to the public on Friday, Dec 9, from
8-10 pm, weather permitting. On this date, Mars will be just 1 day passed
opposition. ``Opposition" is the planetary configuration in which the planet
appears in the opposite direction as the Sun from the Earth's perspective.
It is also the time of closest approach to the Earth, making Mars look
bigger and brighter than usual.  Mars will already be about 35 degrees
above the Eastern horizon at 8 pm.  The Moon, which is full on Dec 7,
will also be above the Eastern horizon, but not close enough to bright
Mars to interfere.  Interestingly, on Dec. 7, the Moon will cover up
(occult) Mars for about 40 minutes as seen from Ada, OH!
<br>
<br>
The forecast (as of 12/7) is calling for 94% cloud cover and rain

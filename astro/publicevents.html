<!-- Actual date of opposition is 9/16 (UT) -->
<br>

<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 9:00-11:00 pm this Friday, September 16 for the first astronomy public
event of the Fall season.   Each event is planned around some theme or a 
celestial happening.  
This Friday, September 16, is the date that Neptune will be
at its closest to the Earth.  That is, Neptune will be in opposition.
This is also when a planet looks its biggest and brightest in a telescope.
Neptune is too faint to see with the unaided  eye, but it appears as a blue
dot through our telescopes.  Saturn, will also be well placed for viewing
because it recently passed opposition on August 14.   It is easier to
see features of Saturn, like its moons and its amazing rings!
Come and see these and other wonders of the night sky!

<br>
<br>
The forecast (as of 9/13) is looking good: partly cloudy and warm (68 F).
We will announce any cancellations by Friday, 2:30 pm, just
below this brown text.

"Autumnal Equinox and Jupiter approaching opposition"

The Moon's phase is 2 days before new (waning crescent)
so deep sky objects, Saturn, Jupiter would be targets.
Jupiter is in opposition on Sept 26.-->

<div class="mynote">
All are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 8:00-10:00 pm this Friday, September 23 for the second astronomy public
event of the Fall season.   This Friday is a celebration of the autumnal equinox
or the start of autumn.  This year, the actual moment when the Sun crosses the
celestial equator on its way south is on September 22
(around 9 pm EST).   After this date, the length of nighttime will surpass 
the length of daytime (which is good for skygazing!).
Saturn will make an excellent target for our telescopes.  Jupiter rises a
little later but is even brighter than Saturn.  In fact, it will be at its
brightest on September 26 when it is closest to the Earth (opposition).
<br><br>
The forecast (as of 9/20) calls for mostly cloudy skies (90% overcast)
and cool (53 F) weather.  This is too cloudy to observe.  We will
post a cancellation notice by Friday, 2:30 pm just below these words.

"Orionid Meteor Shower"
<!--  The Moon phase is waning crescent, so no interference.
Actual peak of meteor shower is Oct 21-22.
-->
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 8:00-10:00 pm this Friday, October 21, for the third public
astronomy event at ONU Observatory for this Fall.
This event is scheduled to coincide with the peak of the Orionid Meteor
Shower.  This is a popular annual meteor shower that emanates from
the constellation Orion.  Meteors (or "falling stars") are bright streaks in
the sky caused by small particles speeding through our atmosphere.  The Orionid meteor
particles originated in Halley's comet. The Orionids are generally
faster and brighter than average.  The rate of meteors will be greater after
midnight when Orion rises, so we will likely only see about 10/hour.
We will also train our telescopes on planets (Jupiter and Saturn) and deep
sky objects.
<br> <br>
The forecast (as of 10/19) is calling for only 10% cloud cover on Friday
and 57 F. If the forecast changes for the worse, a cancellation message
will appear below this text.

	10 meteors per hour, but on certain years (1933, 1946, 2012) it had

	telescopes.  We've identified two such comets for which we may
	be able to obtain and display live images.
	(These are Comet 29P/ Schwassman-Wachmann and Comet C/2019

"Venus, Goddess of Love"
<div class="mynote">
It's Valentine's day! So what better time to look at the love-related
objects in astronomy.  The planet Venus is named after the Roman Goddess of
love and it is an easy target for our telescopes during evenings this spring.
This night also happens to be the Greatest Elongation of Mercury, but it will
be almost set at 7 pm. 
Continuing the Valentine's theme,
we can look for more challenging deep sky objects like the
Heart Nebula and the Heart-shaped Cluster (Messier 50).
It turns out that dozens of heart shaped features have been
discovered on other planets, like Mars, although they are not quite 
visible from ground-based telescopes.

"Leap Days and Time"
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by
the ONU Observatory between 8:00-10:00 pm this Friday night.
Dr. Pinkney plans to give a short presentation about "Leap Days
and Time" at 9 pm.  This year, 2020, is a leap year which means that the
calendar will include a "Feb 29" for the first time in 4 years.
Why do we do this and how long have we been doing it?
Our telescopic targets will include Venus and the Moon, which will be
separated by only 14 degrees.  Uranus is midway between them.
The winter Milky Way with its many interesting deep sky objects will
also be well placed in the sky. <br>

The forecast is currently calling for partly cloudy and cold (20 F)
weather.  We will announce any cancellations by Friday by 2:30.

"Moon in the Beehive"
<div class="mynote">
Buzz by the ONU Observatory on Friday, Mar 6, between 8 and 10 pm
for a star party called "Moon in the Beehive".  The name refers
to the way the Moon will have just passed through the Beehive star cluster in
the constellation Cancer.   
Tonight we'll take on the challenge of spotting and photographing
the faint but large star cluster with a bright Moon nearby.  The bright
Moon itself will be a target of observation.  It will be in a gibbous 
phase (between half and full), with the crater Aristarchus
near the terminator line. 
We can also observe double stars and brighter objects in the 
winter Milky Way like the Orion Nebula. <br>
Mar 6 update: it may be a good night to see lunar halos (because
of the layer of haze expected), but not much else.

Occultations of stars and planets by

the Moon and sometimes blinks off and on as mountains and crater rims
block the light.

(On Daylight Savings Time.  Sun only 3.5 degrees below horizon at 8 pm EDT.
 There will still be twilight at 8:30 pm EDT.
Have a star party to celebrate the vernal equinox, the start of spring!
The actual moment of equinox is 23:50 EDT on Mar 19, but
this is Mar 20 in Universal Time (Greenwich, England).
 The Moon will be waning crescent (below horizon) heading towards a
conjunction with Mercury on 3/21, and new moon on 3/24.  Jupiter and
Mars are also in close conjunction, visible in the morning sky.
 So I could discuss the way the Sun (and new Moon and Full Moon)
 should be close to the celestial equator, rising due east and
 setting due west.
 Except the Moon can be as far as 5.3 degrees above or below
 the ecliptic.

The actual date of greatest elongation east is Mar 24.
On that date it has an altitude of 44 degrees at sunset.
The altitude is still about 44 degrees on 3/27, but it is

because the ecliptic is nearly verticle.
The Moon is only 3 days old, so we can observe the crescent.

"Blue planets in opposition"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
The ONU Astronomy Club wants you to join them on a celebration
of blue planets and Halloween!  Feel free to wear your costume
to this astro-event.  Free glow-stick products for kids while supplies
last.  Halloween is related to astronomy much like the solstices 
and equinoxes.  It evolved out of a pagan celebration of a "cross-quarter"
day, half-way between the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice.
In modern times, the true cross-quarter day is around November 7,
but before the Gregorian calendar was adopted, it fell near Oct 31.

Now for the oppositions.  The blue-green planet Uranus will reach 
opposition on Oct 28 shortly after its closest approach to Earth on 
Oct 27. Meanwhile, blue Neptune passed opposition on Sept. 9.  This means that
both planets are near their optimum observability; they are up
all night and are as close to the Earth as they get.
During tonight's star party, we will glimpse these distant planets and 
perhaps a few of their moons.

"The transit of Mercury across the Sun"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU
Observatory any time between 10:00 am and noon on Monday, November 11.
We will be witnessing a rare celestial event: the transit of
Mercury across the Sun.  The planet Mercury will appear as a
tiny, circular silhouette on the face of the Sun as it
undergoes an almost perfect syzygy (3-body alignment) with the Sun and Earth.
(Warning: don't try to view this without proper filters!)
The center of the event occurs at 10:20 am (EST), and its beginning
and ending are 7:35 am and 1:04 pm EST, respectively.
Mercury transits are not as rare as Venus transits, with 13 or 14
per century, but many of them occur when the Sun is set.
The next transit of Mercury is in November of 2032, but the
next one visible from Ohio will be in May, 2049.
Also, Mercury's minimum separation from the Sun will be only 75.9
arcseconds, the closest of the 21st century.  The next time it
will pass closer than 75" will be on Nov 12, 2190.
We will have several ways of viewing the Sun safely during this event.
If it is cloudy (as forecasted), we will still be open to view
live streaming from other observatories.

"The Fading Comets of 2019" 
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
Three of the four brightest comets in the sky this February
peaked in brightness at the end of 2018.  Comet 46P/Wirtanen was the
brightest of 2018, but it may end up being the brightest
of 2019 unless other comets surpass the expectations.
Additionally, we have 38P/Stephan-Oterma and 64P/Swift-Gehrels
which we enjoyed in 2018 and are still good targets for 
northern telescopes.  We hope to get new glimpses of
these comets on this event on the eve of Groundhog's Day.
If you attended our last event on Dec 7, you will see how
Comet Wirtanen is just a little fainter now, but quite a bit
higher in the sky.

"Greatest elongation of Mercury"
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
The ONU Astronomy Club welcomes Ada and the surrounding communities
to the ONU Observatory on Friday, March 1, for our "Greatest Elongation
of Mercury"  event.  The word "Elongation" refers to the angular
separation between Mercury and the Sun.  Since Mercury's orbit remains
closer to the Sun than the Earth, it can never be farther than
about 28 degrees from the Sun.  This week, Mercury will be at
its maximum elongation on the east side of the Sun.  It's elongation
will actually be about 18.1 degrees since it will be near the
perihelion (nearest point to the Sun) of its orbit.
We will open the observatory relatively early at 7 pm in order to
catch Mercury before it sets in the West.  After setting, there
will still be other wondrous sites to see such as Mars and the
stars of the winter Milky Way.

<!--
Mercury will be about 10 degrees above the W horizon at
7 pm when the Sun is -7.4 degrees below the horizon.
This will be about the best time to glimpse Mercury,
but still a challenge even in clear skies.  So Pinkney
will give a presentation showing where Mercury is 
relative to the Sun and how maximum elongation actually
occurred on Feb 26 (it was 18.13 deg away from the Sun).
He will also give a preview of the November 11 transit of
Mercury across the Sun.

Friday, Mar 22, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Vernal Equinox"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
The ONU Observatory will be open to the public on Friday, March 22,
from 9-11 pm to observe the vernal equinox, or the beginning
of Spring.  The precise time of the equinox is March 20, 5:58 pm EDT,
but the position of the Sun will be nearly the same on March 22.
Coincidentally, a full Moon occurs within 4 hours of the equinox this year.
It has been dubbed the "Super Worm Equinox Moon".
The "Super" refers to the close proximity of the Moon (perigee), while the
"Worm" refers to the way earthworms start appearing in late March!
Expect the Moon to rise nearly due east when the Sun is setting
due west on March 20.
On Friday, March 22, we'll see the (nearly) full Moon rise around
10 pm.  Prior to that, the sky will be dark enough to enjoy
exploring the winter Milky Way.
This is one of the two equinoxes (the other in September) when you
expect to see the length of night and day being nearly equal.
Dr. Pinkney will demonstrate the vernal equinox and full moon
using a planetarium program.

"Supernovae and their remnants"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
Ada and the surrounding communities are invited to the
ONU Observatory on Friday, March 29 from 9-11 pm for
"Supernovae and their remnants".
Stars meet their death in a variety of ways which depends mostly
on their mass.  The most massive
stars end in a spectacular explosion called a supernova.  Those which
occur in our Milky Way galaxy can outshine Venus for a month or more.
They leave behind expanding gas clouds which glow faintly 
for thousands of years.  It turns out that SNRs (supernova
remnants) would seem much brighter if our eyes were sensitive to
radio or x-rays.  We will take a look at a few SNRs that are visible 
in a telescope: the Crab Nebula and the Jellyfish Nebula.  
Ongoing all-sky surveys are discovering about 100 supernovae per
month, but most of these are too faint to see with our ONU telescopes.
(There are currently no bright supernovae in nearby galaxies. )
Low to middleweight
stars like the Sun are not quite as explosive in death, but they
still "puff out" their outer shells to form a beautiful "planetary nebula".
We will also observe examples of these nebulae including the "Cat's
Eye Nebula" and the "Little Dumbbell".

Friday, Apr 5, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Galaxies of Spring"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
Ada and the surrounding communities are invited to the
ONU Observatory on Friday, April 5 from 9-11 pm
for "The Galaxies of Spring".  Galaxies are a swirling collection
of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter.  They are generally
difficult to see with telescopes because they are
so far away and faint.  During this time of the year, however,
the closest concentrations of galaxies are positioned
high in the sky by midnight.  We will be targeting such
galaxies as M66 in Leo and the "Black eye galaxy" in
Coma Berenices for observation with the telescopes.
So come and witness the wonders of the deep sky
as you learn about extragalactic astronomy!

"Eta Aquariid Meteors"
<!--
Eta Aquariids are spread from 4/19-5/28, but the peak is May 5-6.
4/22 Lyrid meteors peak.  Moon is 3 days before new.
-->
<!--
<div class="mynote">
Weather permitting, the ONU Observatory will be open to the 
public on Friday, May 3, from 9-11 pm.  The event is called 
"Eta Aquariid Meteors" because the peak of the Eta Aquariid
annual meteor shower happens soon after (May 5).  The meteor 
activity has a broad peak so some are expected on May 3, 
especially after the constellation Aquarius rises at 3:30 am.  
The shower is named after the closest bright star to the
radiant of the shower.  The radiant is the point from which
the meteors appear to eminate.   The moon will be one day
before its new phase, ideal for meteor-watching.  This 
phase also favors the viewing of deep-sky objects with the
telescopes.  The Eta Aquariid meteor particles were produced long 
ago by Halley's comet.  The meteor is seen when these pea-sized
particles hit Earth's atmosphere at high speeds.  The Eta
Aquariids produce some of the fastest meteors at about 70 km/s
(150,000 mph).

The ONU Observatory will be open to the public on Friday, Sept 7 
from 9:00-11 pm, weather permitting.  On this date, Neptune will be
in opposition. ``Opposition" is the planetary
configuration in which the planet appears in the opposite
direction of the Sun from the Earth's perspective.  It is also
around the time of closest approach to the Earth, making 
the planet look bigger and brighter than average.  (Neptune's
closest approach is actually Sept 6.)  Neptune is now the
most distant of the planets in our solar system, although
a planet IX is suspected to exist.  Neptune can be seen through
telescopes as a pale blue dot.

The ONU Astronomy Club welcomes you to the ONU
Observatory on Friday, Oct 12, 2018 for our
"Observe the Crescent Moon" event.  Stop by
any time between 8 and 10 pm to look through our
telescopes or ask questions about the night sky.
On this night, the Moon will be in a waxing crescent phase,
which is usually a good time to look at lunar craters and
mountains.  In the fall, however, the waxing crescent is
far below the celestial equator, which means it will appear low
on the southwest horizon.  It will begin at a low altitude of 15 
degrees, and set around 9:30 pm.  But do not despair!  
There will be plenty of targets to look at after the Moon 
descends: Mars, Saturn, Uranus, double stars and deep sky objects.

"Asteroids and OSIRIS-REx"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
Asteroids are large rocks which mostly reside between
Mars and Jupiter.  Some of them have ended up on orbits
that get closer to the Sun than the Earth. These Earth-crossing
asteroids (also called potentially hazardous
asteroids, PHAs, and near-Earth asteroids, NEAs) pose a threat
of collision with Earth.  They also pose an opportunity because 
they are relatively easy to visit with our spacecraft.  There
are currently two spacecraft on missions to sample NEAs:
the Japanese "Hayabusa2" will visit Ryugu, and the US "OSIRIS-REx"
will visit Bennu.  They will return samples to Earth telling
giving us vital information needed for planning an asteroid
deflection mission.

OSIRIS-REx is currently about 100 miles from Bennu and taking
images as it slows down for its Dec 3, 2018 encounter. <br>

If weather permits, there will be a Powerpoint presentation 
followed by observations with the telescopes.

<div class="mynote">
The ONU Astronomy Club welcomes Ada and the surrounding communities
to the ONU Observatory on Friday, Dec 7, for our "Comet Wirtanen"
event.  We have been clouded out on previous events but the current
forecast for Friday suggests less than 40% cloudcover ... we may be
able to get a glimpse of the brightest comet of 2018!  This comet is making
a great appearance because it will be passing so close to
the Earth (12 million km, or about 1/13 of the distance to the Sun).
Also, it will be well placed for viewing above the southern horizon.
It is expected to reach naked eye brightness by Dec. 16, the day
of closest approach, but on Dec 7 we will need our telescopes and
binoculars to view it.  We will take color photographs
of the comet which should make its green hue easier to see.
Not far from Comet Wirtanen in the sky are Uranus, the
Pleiades, and Mars, which we can also observe.

The ONU Observatory will be open to the public on Friday,
October 20, from 8-10 pm.  The event is called "The Orionid
Meteors and Comet C/2017 O1".  The Orionid meteor shower
is an annual shower which will peak after midnight of
October 20 when there will be about 20 meteors per hour
under optimum conditions.  A visitor will not experience
optimum conditions, but may still notice a few meteors
streaming out of Orion.  Telescopes do not help you to tally
more meteors, but they do help you see ... comets!  And
there is a comet, "C/2017 O1 ASASSN", that will be in the
northern sky Friday night.  It is a challenge to see, even
through a telescope, so we will display an image on a TV screen.    
The name comes from the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae,
run by OSU.  Meteors are often mistakenly referred to as "comets".
In fact, meteors are tiny fragments shed by comets that are
"burning up" in Earth's atmosphere.  The Orionid meteors actually
originate in the famous Comet Halley.

Comet C/2017 was
discovered by ASASSN survey.  Moving through Taurus and
then Perseus in Sept and October. Reaches Ursa Minor
around 12/22.  Magnitude expected to climb from 10 to ~7.5.
See http://aerith.net/comet/catalog/2017O1/chart2.gif 

Also happening around Oct 20 is Uranus at opposition (Oct 19),
New moon (Oct 19), and Orionid Meteor Shower (Oct 21-22).

Friday, Nov 17, 8:00-10:00 pm.  -- Public Event.
"Leonid Meteor Shower"
<br>
<div class="mynote">
Weather allowing, the ONU Observatory will be open to the 
public on Friday, November 17, from 8-10 pm.
The event is called "The Leonid Meteor Shower".  This shower
is strongest on the mornings of Nov 17 and 18 every year.
It is famous for its occasional outbursts, called "meteor storms"
roughly every 33 years.  The last Leonid storm was in 2001 which
produced thousands of meteors per hour.  The strongest showing
known was in 1833, when about 100,000 meteors fell per hour.
So we don't expect much from the 2017 storm, perhaps 15 meteors
per hour, but there are other reasons to watch the sky on this night.  
The Taurid meteor shower overlaps the Leonids producing fewer meteors
but more fireballs (very bright meteors) and distinctly slower
meteors.  In addition, the planets Neptune and Uranus will be
up, along with loads of deep sky objects.

Monday, Aug 21, 1:30-3:30 pm. -- Public Event.
"The Great American Eclipse" <br><br>
The ONU Observatory will be open to the public from 1:30-3:30 pm
to observe the solar eclipse.  We will not experience totality
from Ada, but the Sun will be covered up to 85%.  It is not
safe to stare directly at the Sun when it is 85% covered by
the Moon, but we will have several ways to safely observe
this event.
These will include the standard "eclipse glasses" and pinhole 
projection viewers.  We will also have at least 3 telescopes
with solar filters providing much higher resolution.
These can reveal sunspots and prominances on the Sun.
For viewers in Ada, the Moon makes its first contact around
1:03 pm, reaches maximum eclipse around 2:28 pm, and
its last contact is around 3:50 pm.  Thus, the Sun will be
partially blocked during the entire scheduled event.

There are no public observatory events scheduled for summer 2016.  We will
have some private viewings for ONU summer programs and other community
organizations.  Generally, only if there is a special celestial event,
like the solar eclipse of Summer 2017, will we schedule a public event 
during the summer.

<h2> Arrange a tour or visit? </h2>
We encourage your K-12 students and other organizations
to visit during the Public Events listed above.  However,
you may be able to schedule a special visit.  We can
comfortably fit about 60 people in the observing room.
Bigger groups can still attend.  During the daytime, we
will show you the building and telescopes and, if clear,
can view the Sun!  We don't roll back the roof if there
is precipitation.  If interested, contact the

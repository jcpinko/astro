 Friday, Feb 9,  8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
 "The Winter Milky Way"
 <br> 

<!--
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding communities are invited to the ONU Observatory
this Friday for a stargazing event called "The Winter Milky Way".
The Milky Way is our home Galaxy. It appears as a swath of light that wraps
around the sky.  In the summer, the Milky Way runs through constellations like
Cygnus (the Swan), while in the winter, it runs 
through Gemini and Canis Major (the great dog) next to Orion.  
In February, this "Winter Milky Way" is crossing the meridian around 9:30 pm, 
making it a good time to explore its treasures with a telescope.  These include
Hubble's Variable Nebula, the Seagull Nebula, and several star clusters. We can
also look at the planets Uranus and Jupiter under the moonless sky.

Friday, Feb 16, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Moon passing through the Pleiades "

<!--
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding communities are invited to the ONU Observatory
this Friday for an astronomy event called "Moon passes through the Pleiades".
The Moon moves through the constellations of the zodiac as it orbits
the Earth and it sometimes passes in front of some interesting stars, or,
even better, star clusters.  This increases the chance of grazing
occultations, when stars blink off and on as they are blocked by the Moon's 
irregular terrain.  The Moon will have already passed the Pleiades by 8 pm
(closest passage around 2:30 pm), so we will mostly use this as an opportunity 
to get a close-up look at the craters and maria of the first quarter Moon.
Other convenient targets will be Jupiter, Uranus, the Pleiades, and 
stars of the winter Milky Way.
-->

<!--
<br>
 Tuesday's forecast for Feb 16, 9:00 pm is 90% cloudcover, 35% chance of
 rain and 29 F.

<div class="cancel">
  This event was cancelled due to clouds and rain.

</div>
<br>

<!--
The first quarter moon will be passing through the Pleiades, or "Seven Sisters"
star cluster just before this evenings event.  This will be a good opportunity
to explore the Moon.  Jupiter and Uranus will also be available for viewing.
-->
<br> 
Friday, Mar 8, 7:30-9:30 pm. -- Public Event.
"Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding communities are invited to the ONU Observatory
this Friday for an astronomy event called "Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks".
Comet Pons-Brooks is currently the brightest comet in the sky, but still 
too faint to see without a telescope.  Comets are icy fragments usually
2-10 km across which give off gas and dust when they get close to the Sun.
This comet comes in close to the Sun, as it is now, once every 70 years.
We start earlier than usual, 7:30 pm, because the comet will be low in the 
northwest and will be too low to observe by about 8:30 pm. But don't despair,
there are other objects for us to observe like the planet Jupiter.
<br>
-->
<!--
<br>
As of Thursday, Mar 7, the forecast for Friday calls for clouds and rain.
I will confirm cancellation with a message here by 2:30 on Friday afternoon.

<div class="cancel">
	This event is cancelled due to the weather.
</div>
-->
</div>

<!--
	The event starts earlier than usual because the comet is low in the NW 
	just after sunset.
	Comet's alt=23 deg at 7:30 pm and 19 deg at 8:00 pm.  It is about 6.7 mag.
	We will watch it until it disappears behind the observatory's wall.
-->

<br> <br>
Friday, Mar 22, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Mercury at dichotomy"
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
This Friday's public event is called "Mercury at dichotomy".  On this day,
Mercury will appear half lit by the Sun, displaying a phase much like the 1st quarter Moon.  Since Mercury's orbit is an ellipse and not a circle, the moment of dichotomy can differ from the moment of it's greatest elongation from the Sun.  The Greatest Elongation East occurs a few days later on Mar 24 this year. Mercury will be almost 19 degrees from the Sun on both occasions, making it a good time to go after this elusive planet.  
<br>
Mercury will get too low to observe by about 8:30 pm, so our telescopes 
will slew to other targets in the Western sky.  These include Jupiter and 
Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks.  We were clouded out during the last event which 
went after the comet, but now it should be brighter and more well-placed 
for observing.  It should have a long tail and be visible in binoculars 23 degrees
northwest of Jupiter.
</div>

<!--
<div class="cancel">

Mercury will appear half lit or in a  first quarter phase.  It
is also be vbery close to its greatest elongation east of the Sun.
"Spring Star Party!"
this is Mar 20 in Universal Time (Greenwich, England).
The Moon will be new on Mar 21! 
Except the Moon can be as far as 5.3 degrees above or below
the ecliptic.

<br> 
Friday, Apr 5, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Galaxies of Spring"
<!--
	One day after new moon - good for finding galaxies. Also mention
	the solar hybrid eclipse that was visible in Australia on 4/20/23.
	Galaxies like M101, M83, and M87 are well placed for viewing,
	along with globular clusters like M3.
-->
<!--
<div class="mynote">
April is a good month to look for galaxies in the Ohio skies!  
The chance of cloudcover is going down and the temperatures are going up.
More importantly, the North Galactic Pole is well placed in the sky before 
midnight.  This is where many of the nearby galaxies are located, residing 
in the Virgo Cluster and various other groups.  On this night, with the 
Moon just past new, we will point our telescopes at galaxies.  They are
generally faint, so we may also use sensitive cameras to display 
them. The Lyrid meteor shower is also producing occasional meteors.

<div class="mynote">
	We have many cameras and telescopes carefully setup for the

Monday, Apr 8, 2:00-4:00 pm. -- Streamed Event. "Total Solar Eclipse!"
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
	Totality of the April 8th solar eclipse can (and should) be viewed outside 
	with your naked eye.  But in the hours of partial eclipse before and after 
	totality, you must use protective eclipse glasses or suffer eye damage.  
	Typical eclipse glasses offer no magnification and you can only perceive 
	the largest of sunspots.  That's why you should
	follow the ONU YouTube livestreaming event from the ONU Observatory. We will
	show images from not just one but three different telescope/cameras set ups.
	We will also provide play-by-play and NASA graphics showing the progress of
	the umbra across the US.
	<br>
	Apr 4 Update: current forecast predicts 55-60% cloudcover and 15% chance of rain
	for Ada on eclipse day.  The streaming event will still be held even if the 
	skies are cloudy.

<!--
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 8:30-10:30 pm this Friday, September 8, for the first public
event of Fall 2023.  The event is called "Saturn puts on a show" because
Saturn has just passed opposition on Sept 27.  This means that it is
relatively close to the Earth and looks big and bright in telescopes.
Planets in opposition also rise right around sunset and stay
up most of the night.  Saturn will be just 10 degrees above the horizon
at 8:30, when we open, but it will only get higher and better over the
next 2 hours.  We will also point our telescopes at other deep sky objects.
One, the "Saturn Nebula", is only about 19 degrees away from the actual planet
Saturn on this night.

	star party!  The autumnal equinox is the start of fall and it officially
	happens on September 23 at 2:50 am Eastern this year.  It is called an
	"equinox" because the length of the daytime hours are about equal to the 
	length of the nighttime hours.  This also happens to be a few days after
	the opposition of Neptune, so it will be optimized for telescopic viewing.

	between 8:00 and 10:00 pm this Friday, November 3 for our "Jupiter at
	its closest" event.  The title refers to the opposition of Jupiter, which
	occurs on this date.   Opposition is when the planet reaches 
	its maximum angle away from the Sun (up to 180 degrees).  This happens 
	a day or two after Earth's closest approach to Jupiter, thus making 
	Jupiter appear big and bright in telescopes around opposition and the

Friday, Nov 17, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Leonid Meteor Shower"
<br>

<!--
<div class="mynote">
The final public event this fall at the ONU Observatory celebrates the Taurid Meteor
Shower.  Meteors are streaks of light in the sky caused by small particles
flying into the atmosphere at high speeds.  Most of the particles originate in the
tails of comets.  The peak of about 15 meteors per hour
is expected on the night of Nov 17-18.  In previous years, there were meteor "storms"
which occurred every 33 years, including 1966 and 1999.
One sees the most meteors by just gazing at the sky without a telescope. But we will have
our telescopes pointed at targets like Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus (which has just
passed opposition).  The comet C/2023 H2 (Lemmon) may also be accessible.  <br>
<br>
The current weather forecast is not looking good for observing on Friday, with 
over 50% cloudcover.  A final decision on cancellation will be posted here

"Leap Days and Time"
Saturday, Feb. 29 is the extra day added to the 2020 calendar to
make it a leap year!  What are leap years and why do we need
them?  The astronomical origins of our system of time will be
discussed.

Friday, Mar 24, 8:30-10:30 pm. -- Public Event.
"Spring Star Party!"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
	The first day of spring in the northern hemisphere, the vernal 
equinox, just happened on March 20.  This is one of the two days in 
the year in which the Sun rises due East and sets due West.  And now
the length of daylight hours is quickly increasing.  To celebrate
the equinox we will be holding a "Spring Star Party" on Friday, March 24.
The waxing crescent Moon will be only 1 degree from Uranus and 6 degrees
from bright Venus.  The Great Orion Nebula and Mars will also be good targets
for our telescopes.
</div>
<div class="cancel">
	This event is cancelled due to cloudy weather in the forecast.
</div>
-->

<!--
(Daylight Savings Time begins Mar 12, so there
 will still be a little twilight at 8:30 pm EDT.)
Have a star party to celebrate the vernal equinox, the start of spring!
The actual moment of equinox is 4 days earlier: 17:24 EDT on Mar 20. 
The Moon will be waning crescent (3.5 d old) passing Venus and Uranus.
Mars will be easily accessible at the Meridian.
I could discuss the way the Sun (and new Moon and Full Moon)
should be close to the celestial equator, rising due east and
setting due west.

Friday, Apr 7, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Mercury at Greatest Elongation"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
This Friday's public event celebrates the Greatest Eastern Elongation of 
Mercury.  This is when Mercury reaches its maximum angular separation
from the Sun in the evening sky.  The actual date of maximum is
April 11, but it will be almost as far on April 7.  The maximum
angle for this GEE will be 19.5 degrees.  It is the time when amateur
astronomers like to view Mercury because it is not lost in the glare
of the Sun.   Mercury will quickly get too low to observe so we will
look at other objects like Mars, Venus and the Great Orion Nebula.
<div>
<div class="itson">
	The weather looks good so this event is on!

	The actual date of greatest elongation east is Apr 11.

<br> <br>
Friday, Apr 21, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Galaxies of Spring"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
April is a good month to look for galaxies in the Ohio skies!  
The chance of cloudcover is going down and the temperatures are going up.
More importantly, the North Galactic Pole is well placed in the sky before 
midnight.  This is where many of the nearby galaxies are located, residing 
in the Virgo Cluster and various other groups.  On this night, with the 
Moon just past new, we will point our telescopes at galaxies.  They are
generally faint, so we may also use sensitive cameras to display 
them. The Lyrid meteor shower is also producing occasional meteors.
</div>
<div class="cancel">
This event is cancelled. 
</div>
<div class="mynote">
	We have many cameras and telescopes carefully setup for the
	total solar eclipse streaming on Monday.  The cables and portable
	telescopes represent a trip hazard so it is best to not hold
	a nighttime event on April 21.
</div>
-->
<!--
	One day after new moon - good for finding galaxies. Also mention
	the solar hybrid eclipse that was visible in Australia on 4/20/23.
	Galaxies like M101, M83, and M87 are well placed for viewing,
	along with globular clusters like M3.

<!-- Comet C2017 K2 PanSTARRS may still be visible near Scorpius
as it heads towards the southern hemisphere.  
Saturn was just in opposition on August 14.  -->
Friday, Sept 16, 9:00-11:00 pm -- Public Event
"Neptune at its closest"
<!-- Actual date of opposition is 9/16 (UT) -->
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 9:00-11:00 pm this Friday, September 16 for the first astronomy public
event of the Fall season.   Each event is planned around some theme or a 
celestial happening.  
This Friday, September 16, is the date that Neptune will be
at its closest to the Earth.  That is, Neptune will be in opposition.
This is also when a planet looks its biggest and brightest in a telescope.
Neptune is too faint to see with the unaided  eye, but it appears as a blue
dot through our telescopes.  Saturn, will also be well placed for viewing
because it recently passed opposition on August 14.   It is easier to
see features of Saturn, like its moons and its amazing rings!
Come and see these and other wonders of the night sky!

<br>
<br>
The forecast (as of 9/13) is looking good: partly cloudy and warm (68 F).
We will announce any cancellations by Friday, 2:30 pm, just
below this brown text.

"Autumnal Equinox and Jupiter approaching opposition"
<!-- actual time of equinox is Sept 22, 9:03 PM EDT.
The Moon's phase is 2 days before new (waning crescent)
so deep sky objects, Saturn, Jupiter would be targets.
Jupiter is in opposition on Sept 26.-->
<!--
<div class="mynote">
All are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 8:00-10:00 pm this Friday, September 23 for the second astronomy public
event of the Fall season.   This Friday is a celebration of the autumnal equinox
or the start of autumn.  This year, the actual moment when the Sun crosses the
celestial equator on its way south is on September 22
(around 9 pm EST).   After this date, the length of nighttime will surpass 
the length of daytime (which is good for skygazing!).
Saturn will make an excellent target for our telescopes.  Jupiter rises a
little later but is even brighter than Saturn.  In fact, it will be at its
brightest on September 26 when it is closest to the Earth (opposition).
<br><br>
The forecast (as of 9/20) calls for mostly cloudy skies (90% overcast)
and cool (53 F) weather.  This is too cloudy to observe.  We will
post a cancellation notice by Friday, 2:30 pm just below these words.

"Orionid Meteor Shower"
<!--  The Moon phase is waning crescent, so no interference.
Actual peak of meteor shower is Oct 21-22.
-->
<!--
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 8:00-10:00 pm this Friday, October 21, for the third public
astronomy event at ONU Observatory for this Fall.
This event is scheduled to coincide with the peak of the Orionid Meteor
Shower.  This is a popular annual meteor shower that emanates from
the constellation Orion.  Meteors (or "falling stars") are bright streaks in
the sky caused by small particles speeding through our atmosphere.  The Orionid meteor
particles originated in Halley's comet. The Orionids are generally
faster and brighter than average.  The rate of meteors will be greater after
midnight when Orion rises, so we will likely only see about 10/hour.
We will also train our telescopes on planets (Jupiter and Saturn) and deep
sky objects.
<br> <br>
The forecast (as of 10/19) is calling for only 10% cloud cover on Friday
and 57 F. If the forecast changes for the worse, a cancellation message
will appear below this text.

"Uranus at Opposition"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 8:00-10:00 pm this Friday, November 11, for the fourth public
astronomy event at ONU Observatory for this Fall.
Q: What's round, green and full of methane gas?  A: Uranus!  Yes, Uranus, the
seventh planet from the Sun is the inspiration for our event this Friday.
It will pass through opposition on November 9th, just a few days earlier.
This is about when the planet is closest to the Earth and appears opposite the
Sun in the sky.  So Uranus tends to look its biggest and brightest in the weeks
around this date.  Still, it is too faint to see with the naked eye so
our telescopes will be needed.  The gibbous Moon, Mars, Saturn and Jupiter
will also be great targets if weather permits!
<br> <br>
The forecast (as of 11/8) is calling for 80% cloud cover on Friday
and 46 F. Unless the forecast improves by Friday at 2:00 pm, a cancellation
message will appear below this text.
</div>

<div class="cancel">
This event was cancelled due to a forecast of cloudcover.
</div>
-->
<!-- Actual date of opposition is 11/9. 11/8 is Full Moon, so 
Moon will rise at 7:30. Uranus will have alt = 32 deg
at 8:00 while the Moon will only be 4.5 deg high.
So Uranus should be observable, but there will be
light pollution as the evening progresses.

"Leonids Meteor Shower"
The Leonids peak on Nov 17-18. Moon phase is waning crescent
so no interference. -->

<br>
Friday, Dec 9, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Opposition of Mars"
<!-- Actual date of opposition is Dec 8.  Moon is Full on 12/7
so Moon will rise a little after Mars. Mars is way above the Cel Eq.
so it is already 35 deg in altitude at 8:00 pm.  The Moon is 23 degrees
below (East of) Mars. -->
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
The ONU Observatory will be open to the public on Friday, Dec 9, from
8-10 pm, weather permitting. On this date, Mars will be just 1 day passed
opposition. ``Opposition" is the planetary configuration in which the planet
appears in the opposite direction as the Sun from the Earth's perspective.
It is also the time of closest approach to the Earth, making Mars look
bigger and brighter than usual.  Mars will already be about 35 degrees
above the Eastern horizon at 8 pm.  The Moon, which is full on Dec 7,
will also be above the Eastern horizon, but not close enough to bright
Mars to interfere.  Interestingly, on Dec. 7, the Moon will cover up
(occult) Mars for about 40 minutes as seen from Ada, OH!
<br>
<br>
The forecast (as of 12/7) is calling for 94% cloud cover and rain
on Friday. Unless the forecast improves by Friday at 2:00 pm, a cancellation
message will appear here: https://jpastro.net/astro/publicevents.html.

Friday, Feb 3,  8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Comet ZTF close to Earth" 
<!--  
	Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) will be closest to Earth (~0.25 AU) on
	Thurs Feb 2 so it should look big on Feb 3 as well.  The nearly
	full Moon will be only 41 degrees away, but the comet will
	reach an altitude of 70 degrees and is expected to be ~5.5 mag
	so we should be able to see it.  10 km nucleus.  May be brightest
	comet of 2023.
 -->
<br> <br>
Friday, Feb 24, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Explore the waxing crescent Moon"
<!--  The Moon is new on Feb 20 and should be 4 days old on Feb 24.
-->
<!-- 
Friday, Feb 28, 8:00-10:00 pm. - Public Event.
"Leap Days and Time"
Saturday, Feb. 29 is the extra day added to the 2020 calendar to
make it a leap year!  What are leap years and why do we need
them?  The astronomical origins of our system of time will be
discussed.
-->
<!--
<br> <br>
Friday, Mar 6, 8:00-10:00 pm. - Public Event.
"Moon in the Beehive"
The gibbous moon will be passing through the beehive.  We'll
take on the challenge of spotting the star cluster with 
the Moon closeby.  We can also observe the Moon and brighter
objects in the winter Milky Way (Orion, etc.).
-->

<br> <br>
Friday, Mar 20, 8:30-10:30 pm. -- Public Event.
"The Vernal Equinox"
<!--
this is Mar 20 in Universal Time (Greenwich, England).
 The Moon will be new on Mar 21! 
 Except the Moon can be as far as 5.3 degrees above or below
 the ecliptic. 
-->
<br> <br>
Friday, Apr 7, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Mercury at Greatest Elongation"
<!--
The actual date of greatest elongation east is Apr 11.
-->
<br> <br>
Friday, Apr 21, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Galaxies of Spring"
<!--
One day after new moon - good for finding galaxies. Also mention
the solar hybrid eclipse that was visible in Australia on 4/20/23.
Galaxies like M101, M83, and M87 are well placed for viewing,
along with globular clusters like M3.

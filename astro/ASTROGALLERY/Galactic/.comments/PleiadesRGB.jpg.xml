  <caption>M45- The Pleiades</caption>
  <note>M45, also known as the Pleiades or the Seven Sisters, is one of the nearest open clusters to Earth. Composed of a grouping of hot young blue stars and their associated reflection nebula, the Pleiades are easily visible to the naked eye near the constellation Taurus, even from light-polluted skies. Taken with Atik 383L CCD and Meade 80mm apochromatic refractor.</note>

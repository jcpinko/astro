  <caption>Full moon rising</caption>
  <note>The full moon rising over the ONU campus, during the March 19, 2011 &quot;supermoon&quot;. This happens when the full moon occurs at perigee, and the Moon is closest to the Earth in its orbit. The March 19 supermoon appeared almost 20% brighter and 15% larger than the average full moon. Taken with Canon Digital Rebel XT. </note>

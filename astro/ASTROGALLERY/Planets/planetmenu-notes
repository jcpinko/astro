My Modifications

Removed share and slideshow buttons.
Removed search bar.
Deleted shareimage.jpg
Deleted slides directory (won't be necessary)
Replaced folderimage.jpg and folderimg.jpg (existing pictures of jupiter from thumbnail selection) with conjunction image

Changed hrefs (links) to the following:
Venus/album/
Mars/album/
Jupiter/album/
Saturn/album/
Uranus/album/
Neptune/album/

IMPORTANT:
Delete the following:
data1.json
deep-data.json
album.rss

If you don't, the links won't go where they are supposed to. BUT this also removes most viewing functionality (which is fine for this menu only).
I will need to figure out an alternative method for other subgalleries within galleries that require viewing functionality. Perhaps editing the json file will work.

The ONU Observatory has been holding public events since Fall of 2010.
These records are currently incomplete and somewhat irregular.
(We're working on it.)  Also, about half of these events were
cancelled because of bad weather (the cancellation record
tends to be worse in the spring than the fall).

"Neptune at its closest"
<!-- Actual date of opposition is 9/16 (UT) -->
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 9:00-11:00 pm this Friday, September 16 for the first astronomy public
event of the Fall season.   Each event is planned around some theme or a 
celestial happening.  
This Friday, September 16, is the date that Neptune will be
at its closest to the Earth.  That is, Neptune will be in opposition.
This is also when a planet looks its biggest and brightest in a telescope.
Neptune is too faint to see with the unaided  eye, but it appears as a blue
dot through our telescopes.  Saturn, will also be well placed for viewing
because it recently passed opposition on August 14.   It is easier to
see features of Saturn, like its moons and its amazing rings!
Come and see these and other wonders of the night sky!

<br>
<br>
The forecast (as of 9/13) is looking good: partly cloudy and warm (68 F).
We will announce any cancellations by Friday, 2:30 pm, just
below this brown text.

so deep sky objects, Saturn, Jupiter would be targets.
Jupiter is in opposition on Sept 26.-->
<!--
<div class="mynote">
All are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 8:00-10:00 pm this Friday, September 23 for the second astronomy public
event of the Fall season.   This Friday is a celebration of the autumnal equinox
or the start of autumn.  This year, the actual moment when the Sun crosses the
celestial equator on its way south is on September 22
(around 9 pm EST).   After this date, the length of nighttime will surpass 
the length of daytime (which is good for skygazing!).
Saturn will make an excellent target for our telescopes.  Jupiter rises a
little later but is even brighter than Saturn.  In fact, it will be at its
brightest on September 26 when it is closest to the Earth (opposition).
<br><br>
The forecast (as of 9/20) calls for mostly cloudy skies (90% overcast)
and cool (53 F) weather.  This is too cloudy to observe.  We will
post a cancellation notice by Friday, 2:30 pm just below these words.

"Orionid Meteor Shower"
<!--  The Moon phase is waning crescent, so no interference.
Actual peak of meteor shower is Oct 21-22.
-->
<!--
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 8:00-10:00 pm this Friday, October 21, for the third public
astronomy event at ONU Observatory for this Fall.
This event is scheduled to coincide with the peak of the Orionid Meteor
Shower.  This is a popular annual meteor shower that emanates from
the constellation Orion.  Meteors (or "falling stars") are bright streaks in
the sky caused by small particles speeding through our atmosphere.  The Orionid meteor
particles originated in Halley's comet. The Orionids are generally
faster and brighter than average.  The rate of meteors will be greater after
midnight when Orion rises, so we will likely only see about 10/hour.
We will also train our telescopes on planets (Jupiter and Saturn) and deep
sky objects.
<br> <br>
The forecast (as of 10/19) is calling for only 10% cloud cover on Friday
and 57 F. If the forecast changes for the worse, a cancellation message
will appear below this text.

"Uranus at Opposition"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory
between 8:00-10:00 pm this Friday, November 11, for the fourth public
astronomy event at ONU Observatory for this Fall.
Q: What's round, green and full of methane gas?  A: Uranus!  Yes, Uranus, the
seventh planet from the Sun is the inspiration for our event this Friday.
It will pass through opposition on November 9th, just a few days earlier.
This is about when the planet is closest to the Earth and appears opposite the
Sun in the sky.  So Uranus tends to look its biggest and brightest in the weeks
around this date.  Still, it is too faint to see with the naked eye so
our telescopes will be needed.  The gibbous Moon, Mars, Saturn and Jupiter
will also be great targets if weather permits!
<br> <br>
The forecast (as of 11/8) is calling for 80% cloud cover on Friday
and 46 F. Unless the forecast improves by Friday at 2:00 pm, a cancellation
message will appear below this text.
</div>

<div class="cancel">
This event was cancelled due to a forecast of cloudcover.
</div>
-->
<!-- Actual date of opposition is 11/9. 11/8 is Full Moon, so 
Moon will rise at 7:30. Uranus will have alt = 32 deg
at 8:00 while the Moon will only be 4.5 deg high.
So Uranus should be observable, but there will be
light pollution as the evening progresses.

<br>
Friday, Dec 9, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Opposition of Mars"
<!-- Actual date of opposition is Dec 8.  Moon is Full on 12/7
so Moon will rise a little after Mars. Mars is way above the Cel Eq.
so it is already 35 deg in altitude at 8:00 pm.  The Moon is 23 degrees
below (East of) Mars. -->
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
The ONU Observatory will be open to the public on Friday, Dec 9, from
8-10 pm, weather permitting. On this date, Mars will be just 1 day passed
opposition. ``Opposition" is the planetary configuration in which the planet
appears in the opposite direction as the Sun from the Earth's perspective.
It is also the time of closest approach to the Earth, making Mars look
bigger and brighter than usual.  Mars will already be about 35 degrees
above the Eastern horizon at 8 pm.  The Moon, which is full on Dec 7,
will also be above the Eastern horizon, but not close enough to bright
Mars to interfere.  Interestingly, on Dec. 7, the Moon will cover up
(occult) Mars for about 40 minutes as seen from Ada, OH!
<br>
<br>
The forecast (as of 12/7) is calling for 94% cloud cover and rain
on Friday. Unless the forecast improves by Friday at 2:00 pm, a cancellation
message will appear here: https://jpastro.net/astro/publicevents.html.

It's Valentine's day! So what better time to look at the love-related
objects in astronomy.  The planet Venus is named after the Roman Goddess of
love and it is an easy target for our telescopes during evenings this spring.
This night also happens to be the Greatest Elongation of Mercury, but it will
be almost set at 7 pm. 
Continuing the Valentine's theme,
we can look for more challenging deep sky objects like the
Heart Nebula and the Heart-shaped Cluster (Messier 50).
It turns out that dozens of heart shaped features have been
discovered on other planets, like Mars, although they are not quite 
visible from ground-based telescopes.

"Leap Days and Time"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by
the ONU Observatory between 8:00-10:00 pm this Friday night.
Dr. Pinkney plans to give a short presentation about "Leap Days
and Time" at 9 pm.  This year, 2020, is a leap year which means that the
calendar will include a "Feb 29" for the first time in 4 years.
Why do we do this and how long have we been doing it?
Our telescopic targets will include Venus and the Moon, which will be
separated by only 14 degrees.  Uranus is midway between them.
The winter Milky Way with its many interesting deep sky objects will
also be well placed in the sky. <br>

The forecast is currently calling for partly cloudy and cold (20 F)
weather.  We will announce any cancellations by Friday by 2:30.

"Moon in the Beehive"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
Buzz by the ONU Observatory on Friday, Mar 6, between 8 and 10 pm
for a star party called "Moon in the Beehive".  The name refers
to the way the Moon will have just passed through the Beehive star cluster in
the constellation Cancer.   
Tonight we'll take on the challenge of spotting and photographing
the faint but large star cluster with a bright Moon nearby.  The bright
Moon itself will be a target of observation.  It will be in a gibbous 
phase (between half and full), with the crater Aristarchus
near the terminator line. 
We can also observe double stars and brighter objects in the 
winter Milky Way like the Orion Nebula. <br>
Mar 6 update: it may be a good night to see lunar halos (because
of the layer of haze expected), but not much else.

On that date it has an altitude of 44 degrees at sunset.
The altitude is still about 44 degrees on 3/27, but it is
a little closer to us.  This is a good apparition of Venus
because the ecliptic is nearly verticle.

With the Moon down until 11:30 pm, this will be a great night

"Blue planets in opposition"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
The ONU Astronomy Club wants you to join them on a celebration
of blue planets and Halloween!  Feel free to wear your costume
to this astro-event.  Free glow-stick products for kids while supplies
last.  Halloween is related to astronomy much like the solstices 
and equinoxes.  It evolved out of a pagan celebration of a "cross-quarter"
day, half-way between the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice.
In modern times, the true cross-quarter day is around November 7,
but before the Gregorian calendar was adopted, it fell near Oct 31.

Now for the oppositions.  The blue-green planet Uranus will reach 
opposition on Oct 28 shortly after its closest approach to Earth on 
Oct 27. Meanwhile, blue Neptune passed opposition on Sept. 9.  This means that
both planets are near their optimum observability; they are up
all night and are as close to the Earth as they get.
During tonight's star party, we will glimpse these distant planets and 
perhaps a few of their moons.

"The transit of Mercury across the Sun"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU
Observatory any time between 10:00 am and noon on Monday, November 11.
We will be witnessing a rare celestial event: the transit of
Mercury across the Sun.  The planet Mercury will appear as a
tiny, circular silhouette on the face of the Sun as it
undergoes an almost perfect syzygy (3-body alignment) with the Sun and Earth.
(Warning: don't try to view this without proper filters!)
The center of the event occurs at 10:20 am (EST), and its beginning
and ending are 7:35 am and 1:04 pm EST, respectively.
Mercury transits are not as rare as Venus transits, with 13 or 14
per century, but many of them occur when the Sun is set.
The next transit of Mercury is in November of 2032, but the
next one visible from Ohio will be in May, 2049.
Also, Mercury's minimum separation from the Sun will be only 75.9
arcseconds, the closest of the 21st century.  The next time it
will pass closer than 75" will be on Nov 12, 2190.
We will have several ways of viewing the Sun safely during this event.
If it is cloudy (as forecasted), we will still be open to view
live streaming from other observatories.

peaked in brightness at the end of 2018.  Comet 46P/Wirtanen was the
brightest of 2018, but it may end up being the brightest
of 2019 unless other comets surpass the expectations.
Additionally, we have 38P/Stephan-Oterma and 64P/Swift-Gehrels
which we enjoyed in 2018 and are still good targets for 
northern telescopes.  We hope to get new glimpses of
these comets on this event on the eve of Groundhog's Day.
If you attended our last event on Dec 7, you will see how
Comet Wirtanen is just a little fainter now, but quite a bit
higher in the sky.

"Greatest elongation of Mercury"
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
The ONU Astronomy Club welcomes Ada and the surrounding communities
to the ONU Observatory on Friday, March 1, for our "Greatest Elongation
of Mercury"  event.  The word "Elongation" refers to the angular
separation between Mercury and the Sun.  Since Mercury's orbit remains
closer to the Sun than the Earth, it can never be farther than
about 28 degrees from the Sun.  This week, Mercury will be at
its maximum elongation on the east side of the Sun.  It's elongation
will actually be about 18.1 degrees since it will be near the
perihelion (nearest point to the Sun) of its orbit.
We will open the observatory relatively early at 7 pm in order to
catch Mercury before it sets in the West.  After setting, there
will still be other wondrous sites to see such as Mars and the
stars of the winter Milky Way.

Mercury will be about 10 degrees above the W horizon at
7 pm when the Sun is -7.4 degrees below the horizon.
This will be about the best time to glimpse Mercury,
but still a challenge even in clear skies.  So Pinkney
will give a presentation showing where Mercury is 
relative to the Sun and how maximum elongation actually
occurred on Feb 26 (it was 18.13 deg away from the Sun).
He will also give a preview of the November 11 transit of
Mercury across the Sun.

"Vernal Equinox"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
The ONU Observatory will be open to the public on Friday, March 22,
from 9-11 pm to observe the vernal equinox, or the beginning
of Spring.  The precise time of the equinox is March 20, 5:58 pm EDT,
but the position of the Sun will be nearly the same on March 22.
Coincidentally, a full Moon occurs within 4 hours of the equinox this year.
It has been dubbed the "Super Worm Equinox Moon".
The "Super" refers to the close proximity of the Moon (perigee), while the
"Worm" refers to the way earthworms start appearing in late March!
Expect the Moon to rise nearly due east when the Sun is setting
due west on March 20.
On Friday, March 22, we'll see the (nearly) full Moon rise around
10 pm.  Prior to that, the sky will be dark enough to enjoy
exploring the winter Milky Way.
This is one of the two equinoxes (the other in September) when you
expect to see the length of night and day being nearly equal.
Dr. Pinkney will demonstrate the vernal equinox and full moon
using a planetarium program.

"Supernovae and their remnants"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
Ada and the surrounding communities are invited to the
ONU Observatory on Friday, March 29 from 9-11 pm for
"Supernovae and their remnants".
Stars meet their death in a variety of ways which depends mostly
on their mass.  The most massive
stars end in a spectacular explosion called a supernova.  Those which
occur in our Milky Way galaxy can outshine Venus for a month or more.
They leave behind expanding gas clouds which glow faintly 
for thousands of years.  It turns out that SNRs (supernova
remnants) would seem much brighter if our eyes were sensitive to
radio or x-rays.  We will take a look at a few SNRs that are visible 
in a telescope: the Crab Nebula and the Jellyfish Nebula.  
Ongoing all-sky surveys are discovering about 100 supernovae per
month, but most of these are too faint to see with our ONU telescopes.
(There are currently no bright supernovae in nearby galaxies. )
Low to middleweight
stars like the Sun are not quite as explosive in death, but they
still "puff out" their outer shells to form a beautiful "planetary nebula".
We will also observe examples of these nebulae including the "Cat's
Eye Nebula" and the "Little Dumbbell".

<div class="mynote">
Ada and the surrounding communities are invited to the
ONU Observatory on Friday, April 5 from 9-11 pm
for "The Galaxies of Spring".  Galaxies are a swirling collection
of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter.  They are generally
difficult to see with telescopes because they are
so far away and faint.  During this time of the year, however,
the closest concentrations of galaxies are positioned
high in the sky by midnight.  We will be targeting such
galaxies as M66 in Leo and the "Black eye galaxy" in
Coma Berenices for observation with the telescopes.
So come and witness the wonders of the deep sky

<!--
Eta Aquariids are spread from 4/19-5/28, but the peak is May 5-6.
4/22 Lyrid meteors peak.  Moon is 3 days before new.
-->
<!--
<div class="mynote">
Weather permitting, the ONU Observatory will be open to the 
public on Friday, May 3, from 9-11 pm.  The event is called 
"Eta Aquariid Meteors" because the peak of the Eta Aquariid
annual meteor shower happens soon after (May 5).  The meteor 
activity has a broad peak so some are expected on May 3, 
especially after the constellation Aquarius rises at 3:30 am.  
The shower is named after the closest bright star to the
radiant of the shower.  The radiant is the point from which
the meteors appear to eminate.   The moon will be one day
before its new phase, ideal for meteor-watching.  This 
phase also favors the viewing of deep-sky objects with the
telescopes.  The Eta Aquariid meteor particles were produced long 
ago by Halley's comet.  The meteor is seen when these pea-sized
particles hit Earth's atmosphere at high speeds.  The Eta
Aquariids produce some of the fastest meteors at about 70 km/s
(150,000 mph).

On this night, the Moon will be in a waxing crescent phase,
which is usually a good time to look at lunar craters and
mountains.  In the fall, however, the waxing crescent is
far below the celestial equator, which means it will appear low
on the southwest horizon.  It will begin at a low altitude of 15

"Asteroids and OSIRIS-REx"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
Asteroids are large rocks which mostly reside between
Mars and Jupiter.  Some of them have ended up on orbits
that get closer to the Sun than the Earth. These Earth-crossing
asteroids (also called potentially hazardous
asteroids, PHAs, and near-Earth asteroids, NEAs) pose a threat
of collision with Earth.  They also pose an opportunity because 
they are relatively easy to visit with our spacecraft.  There
are currently two spacecraft on missions to sample NEAs:
the Japanese "Hayabusa2" will visit Ryugu, and the US "OSIRIS-REx"
will visit Bennu.  They will return samples to Earth telling
giving us vital information needed for planning an asteroid
deflection mission.

OSIRIS-REx is currently about 100 miles from Bennu and taking

event.  We have been clouded out on previous events but the current
forecast for Friday suggests less than 40% cloudcover ... we may be
able to get a glimpse of the brightest comet of 2018!  This comet is making
a great appearance because it will be passing so close to
the Earth (12 million km, or about 1/13 of the distance to the Sun).
Also, it will be well placed for viewing above the southern horizon.
It is expected to reach naked eye brightness by Dec. 16, the day
of closest approach, but on Dec 7 we will need our telescopes and
binoculars to view it.  We will take color photographs
of the comet which should make its green hue easier to see.
Not far from Comet Wirtanen in the sky are Uranus, the

The ONU Observatory will be open to the public on Friday,
October 20, from 8-10 pm.  The event is called "The Orionid
Meteors and Comet C/2017 O1".  The Orionid meteor shower
is an annual shower which will peak after midnight of
October 20 when there will be about 20 meteors per hour
under optimum conditions.  A visitor will not experience
optimum conditions, but may still notice a few meteors
streaming out of Orion.  Telescopes do not help you to tally
more meteors, but they do help you see ... comets!  And
there is a comet, "C/2017 O1 ASASSN", that will be in the
northern sky Friday night.  It is a challenge to see, even
through a telescope, so we will display an image on a TV screen.    
The name comes from the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae,
run by OSU.  Meteors are often mistakenly referred to as "comets".
In fact, meteors are tiny fragments shed by comets that are
"burning up" in Earth's atmosphere.  The Orionid meteors actually
originate in the famous Comet Halley.

"Leonid Meteor Shower"
<br>
<div class="mynote">
Weather allowing, the ONU Observatory will be open to the 
public on Friday, November 17, from 8-10 pm.
The event is called "The Leonid Meteor Shower".  This shower
is strongest on the mornings of Nov 17 and 18 every year.
It is famous for its occasional outbursts, called "meteor storms"
roughly every 33 years.  The last Leonid storm was in 2001 which
produced thousands of meteors per hour.  The strongest showing
known was in 1833, when about 100,000 meteors fell per hour.
So we don't expect much from the 2017 storm, perhaps 15 meteors
per hour, but there are other reasons to watch the sky on this night.  
The Taurid meteor shower overlaps the Leonids producing fewer meteors
but more fireballs (very bright meteors) and distinctly slower
meteors.  In addition, the planets Neptune and Uranus will be
up, along with loads of deep sky objects.

Monday, Aug 21, 1:30-3:30 pm. -- Public Event.
"The Great American Eclipse" <br><br>
The ONU Observatory will be open to the public from 1:30-3:30 pm
to observe the solar eclipse.  We will not experience totality
from Ada, but the Sun will be covered up to 85%.  It is not
safe to stare directly at the Sun when it is 85% covered by
the Moon, but we will have several ways to safely observe
this event.
These will include the standard "eclipse glasses" and pinhole 
projection viewers.  We will also have at least 3 telescopes
with solar filters providing much higher resolution.
These can reveal sunspots and prominances on the Sun.
For viewers in Ada, the Moon makes its first contact around
1:03 pm, reaches maximum eclipse around 2:28 pm, and
its last contact is around 3:50 pm.  Thus, the Sun will be
partially blocked during the entire scheduled event.

The ONU Observatory will be open to the public from
8 - 10 pm on Friday, January 27, 2017 for our first event
of the Spring semester.  It is entitled "The ISS flies
by Mars and Venus".  Around 8:24 pm, EST, the ISS
(International Space Station) will rise in the southwest
and pass by Venus and Mars as seen from Ada, OH.  The
brightness of the ISS will only be rivaled by Venus.

"Brilliant Venus"
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
The ONU Observatory will be open to the public from
8 - 10 pm on Friday, February 17, 2017 for our
"Brilliant Venus" event.
Have you noticed Venus getting brighter in the western
sky after sunset?  It reaches its "maximum brilliancy" on
Feb 16, and we will be celebrating this on our Friday
public event.  Venus will greatly outshine nearby Mars and
Uranus.  Through the telescope, you will discern it's crescent
phase.  Maximum brilliancy is the moment when the illuminated
part of Venus presents to us the largest solid angle (an angular area).
This actually occurs a little while after the date of maximum
brightness, and before Venus is closest to the Earth.
At any rate, Venus is cool ... or rather, hot!  At 860 degrees
F, it is hot enough to melt lead and its clouds contain
sulfuric acid.  In addition to viewing Venus, Mars and Uranus,
we can observe deep sky objects like the Great Orion Nebula
without interference by moonlight.
</div>

<!--
Venus reaches "Greatest Brilliancy" on Feb 16, but it will be just
about as big and bright on this day.  Plus, Venus, Mars and Uranus
are 2 days away (2/19) from conjunction.

any time between 8 and 10 pm to look through our
telescopes or ask questions about the night sky.
On this night, the crescent Moon will be high in the
southwest, well placed for viewing.  The phase is
a good one for seeing interesting lunar features
such as the Posidonius Crater with its fissures, and
Mare Tranquillitatus, where Apollo 11 landed.

Ada and the surrounding communities are invited to the
ONU Observatory on Friday, March 17 from 9-11 pm for
"Star Formation in Orion".  It may seem like the stars are
eternal, but they do eventually die out.  They are also
born hundreds at a time out of giant clouds of gas and dust.
One of the most frequently studied
and nearby "stellar nurseries" is in the constellation Orion.
It is called the "Orion Nebula" and it is one of the easiest
nebulosities to see with a telescope.
The Orion Nebula will be well-placed in the sky for observing
during our event.  There will also be a short presentation
about star formation showing beautiful images of the Orion
Nebula and other sites of star formation.

<div class="mynote">
The ONU Observatory will be open to the public from 9 - 11 pm
on Friday, March 31.  This event was originally meant to
highlight Mercury, which is near its greatest eastern
elongation away from the Sun.  However, a periodic comet
called 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak has come to steal the show.
It is just a little under the naked eye limit but easily
seen in a telescope.  At its closest on Apr 1 (no fooling),
the comet will be unusually close to the Earth: 14% of the
Earth-Sun distance. It will be positioned
in the constellation Ursa Major and flying out of
the cup of the Big Dipper asterism.
Also available for viewing will be the crescent Moon
and the Great Orion Nebula.

Mercury is at Greatest East.Elong. on 4/1/17.  Its elongation at GEE
will be about 19 degrees and it is a good appearance in that the
line from the Sun to Mercury is almost perpendicular to the horizon.
The Moon will be a crescent (20%) in the West and Jupiter will rise
later in the Night.  Hydra near the meridian.
The biggest elongation angle between 2010-2020 is 27.8 deg and

Friday, Apr 7, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Jupiter at opposition"
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
The ONU Astronomy Club hosts a free astronomy event on Friday,
April 7 from 9-11 pm.  The main attraction will be Jupiter which
reaches opposition on this day.  Opposition is when superior
planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc), are seen in the opposite
direction as the Sun from the Earth's perspective. That is, the
Earth is located directly in-between the Sun and that planet.
This is a great time to look at the planet
since it is as close to us as it gets.  Jupiter will rise around
9 pm in the constellation Virgo and reach an altitude of 10 degrees
by 9:40 pm, EDT. A nearly-full Moon will be nearby in the
constellation Leo.  Weather permitting, it should be a good night to enjoy some
of the brighter celestial objects!

<!--
<div class="mynote">
Ada and the surrounding communities are invited to the
ONU Observatory on Friday, April 21 from 9-11 pm
for "The Galaxies of Spring".  Galaxies are a swirling collection
of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter.  They are generally
difficult to see with telescopes because they are
so far away and faint.  During this time of the year, however,
the closest concentrations of galaxies are positioned
high in the sky by midnight.  We will be targeting such
galaxies as M66 in Leo and the "Black eye galaxy" in
Coma Berenices for observation with the telescopes.
By sheer luck, at 9:47 pm, an Iridium satellite is scheduled to flare
brightly just as it passes into Coma Berenices; a dot as bright
as Venus will momentarily mark our Milky Way's North Galactic
Pole!   So come and witness the wonders of the deep sky
as you learn about extragalactic astronomy!

	The ONU Astronomy Club will host a free event for the

	The theme is "The Blue Planets: Uranus and Neptune".
	These outermost two Jovian planets
	both have bluish hues attributed to methane in
	their atmospheres.  Each planet has an interesting history
	and unique characteristics.  Uranus is tilted about 98
	degrees onto its side so it has the most extreme seasons.
	It's moons (some of which can be spotted with our
	telescopes) are named after characters in works of
	Shakespeare and Pope.  The biggest Moon of Neptune, Triton, orbits
	retrograde to the planet's spin and is expected to one day merge with
	Neptune.  Neptune is also now the furthest
	planet from the Sun in our solar system, since Pluto was
	demoted.  But probably not for long. Astronomers are closing
	in on a "Planet IX" lurking somewhere in the Kuiper Belt.

	What better way to spend a "Black Friday" night than at
	the ONU Observatory looking at stars and planets?
	On November 25, 8-10 pm, the ONU Astronomy Club hosts
	its last event of the fall, "What we learned from
	New Horizons".  Since most of the students will be
	gone for break, we especially encourage the families of
	Ada and it's surrounding communities to come by with their
	questions about astronomy.

	The title refers to the New Horizons spacecraft that
	flew past the dwarf planet Pluto on July 14, 2015.  Since
	the flyby, it has been slowly trasmitting data back to
	Earth, and the last bits didn't arrive until Oct 25, 2016.
	Although Pluto is too faint to see through our telescopes,
	there will be a presentation around 9pm about this interesting
	object.  Of course, other objects will be accessible to our

<br>
<small> &gt;&gt;If the skies are clear, we plan to track down a new
Comet,
Uranus, and deep sky objects like the Ring Nebula
and the Andromeda Galaxy in our telescopes.
Weather forecast (as of Fri afternoon) is for clear skies and 40-45
degrees F.

Friday, November 2, 8:00 - 10:00 pm. --- "Comet Hergenrother flies
through Pegasus" Public Event
<span style="color: rgb(255, 100, 0);"> --Done. </span>
<br>

<small> &gt;&gt;
Tonight's featured target will be Comet 168/P Hergenrother which
is well-placed for observing in the constellation
of Pegasus. This comet has been brighter than expected
and is sporting a short tail. We will also observe various
deep sky objects, such as the Saturn Nebula and the Andromeda
Galaxy. Later in the evening, the planet Jupiter will rise
in the east, followed closely by the Moon.
</small><br>
<br>

Saturday, November 17, 8:00 - 10:00 pm. --- "Leonid Meteor Shower"
Public Event
<span style="color: rgb(255, 100, 0);"> --Done. </span>
<br>

<small>
Tonight's event is chosen to coincide with the
peak of the Leonid Meteor Shower. This annual shower has
periodically produced "storms" of meteor activity, but
tonight it is only expected to produce 10-15 meteors/hour
for a given viewer. Meteors are also called "shooting stars".
They are the sand-grain-sized debris of comets that enter
the Earth's atmosphere so quickly that they create a bright
streak of light. The Leonid meteors originated in the
Comet Temple-Tuttle.
We will also observe various deep sky objects, the crescent
moon, and planets like Uranus and Jupiter.
</small>
<br>
<br>

Friday, December 7, 8:00 - 10:00 pm. --- "Jupiter at its Brightest"
Public Event
<span style="color: rgb(255, 100, 0);"> --Done. </span>
<br>
<small>
Jupiter recently passed through opposition on December 2. Opposition is
the configuration in which a planet appears from Earth to be in the
opposite direction as the Sun.
This is also the time in which the planet looks the brightest to us
because of its full
phase and its proximity to the Earth. During tonight's event, Jupiter
is still
nearly optimal in appearance, and so we will keep it in at least one
telescope all
night. In two hours, the planet rotates 1/5 of a full revolution and we
will watch
for moving features like the Great Red Spot and shadows cast by its
moons.
The view to the unaided eye is also spectacular since Jupiter will be
embedded in bright winter asterisms like the Pleiades and Orion, and
less than 5 degrees from the orange star Aldebaran. We plan to keep a
live Jupiter
video feed on our wall TV for easy viewing.
Other targets tonight may be the Great Orion Nebula, the Pleiades, and
Uranus.
If you've already seen these, feel free to request something new!

The actual peak in shower activity should occur
on the night of Aug 12-13 this year, but the meteors (or "shooting
stars") are visible over 5 days before and after this peak . The Moon
will not be up to interfere with the viewing. <br>

Perseid meteoroids are fragments of the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle which
are usually smaller than a pea. The meteors radiate away from the
constellation Perseus, sometimes exhibiting colors and glowing trains. <br>
      <br>
One does not need a telescope to view the Perseids, but our roll-off
roof observatory serves as a nice setting to view them. Also, the
telescopes will be in operation so you can take a break from meteors to
view planets or deep sky objects. You are encouraged to bring a
lawnchair to set up on the fields next to the observatory. See you
there! <br>

Venus played an important role in the history
of astronomy. The distance to Venus can be found using
trigonometric parallax if two observers on Earth can record
the ingress and egress times from widely separated locations.
With the distance to Venus known, one can calculate the average
distance between the Earth and the Sun (the Astronomical Unit,
92,955,807 miles), which is essential for finding the distance
to everything else in the universe. The first voyage of James Cook was
a mission to observe the 1761 transit of Venus from Tahiti. Subsequent
expeditions to observe transits of 1769, 1874 and 1882 allowed more
precise timings as astronomers learned how to deal with an optical
phenomenon called the ``black drop effect". </font><small><br>

Churyumov-Gerasimenko, a spacecraft called "Rosetta" has just reached
the comet and is finding the optimum site for a November landing.&nbsp;
While Comet 67P will not easily be visible from Earth, Comet Jacques is
expected to be well-placed in the sky and bright enough for easy
telescopic viewing.&nbsp; Comet Jacques is expected to be at its
minimum distance from the Earth, 0.6 AU, on this date, Aug 29.<br>

galaxies, in particular the Andromeda Galaxy, which is the closest
large spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way.  (It's "only" 2 million

be there to point out this galaxy in the sky. (The Andromeda galaxy 
is just visible to the naked eye on a dark night, if you strain.)

<span style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);">&nbsp; <small>
Everyone is invited to the ONU Observatory on Friday, October 17
from 8-10 pm for "The Opposition of Uranus".  The planet Uranus
reached opposition on Tuesday, October 7.  On that day, it was
opposite the Sun in the sky and at about its closest approach
to Earth.  On October 17, although a little farther away,
it will be well placed for observing in the early evening. 
Neptune also reached opposition (8/29) so it is also a good
target for observing.  These planets are not bright enough 
to be seen with the naked eye but look like bluish spheres in
the telescopes.  Come and see these distant, gas giants and
you may even see their brightest Moons (Ariel and Triton).
<br>
<br>
        As a bonus, we will try to glimpse Comet Siding Spring
which is scheduled for a 
<a href ="http://earthsky.org/space/comet-siding-springs-close-encounter-with-mars"
> close encounter with Mars </a> just 2 days
later (10/19)!  Mars and the comet, less than 2 degrees apart, 
will be best viewed at the beginning of our event since they set
around 9:50 pm.

Everyone is invited to the ONU Observatory on Friday,
October 31, 8-10 pm, for "Halloween and the Moon".  This
is the first of our events to feature the Moon this fall, and the
first event ever to be held on Halloween!  The 
Moon will be well-placed for viewing above the southern 
horizon and its phase will be just past 1st quarter.
(Werewolfs don't come out unless the Moon is *full*.  So
we're safe and parents can rest in peace.) 
The lunar craters, maria and mountains are 
astounding to view through the eyepiece, and we will keep a
telescope on the Moon at all times.  We will also display 
a live image on a TV monitor. 
<br>
<br>
Doc Pinkney and his observatory assistants will be armed
with lasers and prepared for Halloween lunacy.  There will 
be sound and video from 1950's sci-fi and horror movies.
You are welcome to dress in a halloween costume, but
keep in mind that there is no roof on the observatory (so it
can be cold, bitterly cold, and alien abductions are a concern).

This event will be canceled in the event of an invasion 
of cloudy weather.  Check this web site on the afternoon

Everyone is invited to the ONU Observatory on Friday,
November 14, 8-10 pm, for "Seeing in the Leonids".  
The Leonid meteor shower will peak around November 17
this year, but it has a typical duration of about 4
days, so it will be just starting up. Moreover, there
are two other showers that should still be producing
meteors: the Taurids (peak Nov 5, duration 45 days),
and the Pegasids (peaks Nov 12).  The Taurids are
famous for producing very bright meteors called "fireballs".
Some have already been 
<a href = "http://www.amsmeteors.org/2014/11/major-fireball-over-eastern-usa-november-3-2014/ " > witnessed this fall from Ohio. </a>

stars (weather permitting) looking through telescopes at stars, 
planets and deep sky objects.

<!--
<span style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"> 
Everyone is invited to the ONU Observatory on Friday,
December 12, 8-10 pm, for "The Geminid Meteor Shower".
This annual meteor shower will peak on Dec 13, but
will be producing meteors already on Dec 12.
Meteors (or shooting stars) are bright streaks across
the sky caused by cometary or asteroid debris entering
Earth's atmosphere at high speeds (10-45 miles/sec).
This shower radiates from the constellation Gemini
and produces one of the highest peak rates of all annual 
showers, 60 per hour.  The meteor particles come from 
an unusual object, 3200 Phaethon,  which appears to be 
a kind of burned-out comet called a "rock-comet".
Fortunately, the Moon will not interfere with viewing.
Telescopes are not needed to view meteors, so ours 
will be pointed at a variety of objects like
Neptune, Uranus, the Orion Nebula, and the Pleiades.
<br>
<br>

As always, the event will be canceled by Friday 
afternoon if clouds are in the forecast.  Watch
this spot ...

<small> &gt;&gt;If the skies are clear, we plan to track down a new Comet,
Uranus, and deep sky objects like the Ring Nebula

<br>
<small> &gt;&gt;
Tonight's featured target will be Comet 168/P Hergenrother which 
is well-placed for observing in the constellation
of Pegasus.  This comet has been brighter than expected
and is sporting a short tail.  We will also observe various
deep sky objects, such as the Saturn Nebula and the Andromeda
Galaxy.  Later in the evening, the planet Jupiter will rise
in the east, followed closely by the Moon.

Tonight's event is chosen to coincide with the
peak of the Leonid Meteor Shower.  This annual shower has
periodically produced "storms" of meteor activity, but 
tonight it is only expected to produce 10-15 meteors/hour
for a given viewer.  Meteors are also called "shooting stars".
They are the sand-grain-sized debris of comets that enter
the Earth's atmosphere so quickly that they create a bright
streak of light.  The Leonid meteors originated in the 
Comet Temple-Tuttle.

We will also observe various deep sky objects, the crescent
moon, and planets like Uranus and Jupiter.
<br>
The observatory will be closed if heavy clouds or precipitation
are forecasted.  Check this spot for cancellations (in red) on
the afternoon before the event.
If it is clear, dress warmly - the observation deck is not heated (although
the bathrooms and control room are).

Friday, December 7, 8:00 - 10:00 pm.  --- "Jupiter at its Brightest" Public Event
<span style="color: rgb(255, 100, 0);"> --Done.  </span> 
<br>
Jupiter recently passed through opposition on December 2.  Opposition is
the configuration in which a planet appears from Earth to be in the opposite direction as the Sun.
This is also the time in which the planet looks the brightest to us because of its full
phase and its proximity to the Earth.  During tonight's event, Jupiter is still
nearly optimal in appearance, and so we will keep it in at least one telescope all
night. In two hours, the planet rotates 1/5 of a full revolution and we will watch
for moving features like the Great Red Spot and shadows cast by its moons.
The view to the unaided eye is also spectacular since Jupiter will be 
embedded in bright winter asterisms like the Pleiades and Orion, and 
less than 5 degrees from the orange star Aldebaran. We plan to keep a live Jupiter
video feed on our wall TV for easy viewing.

Other targets tonight may be the Great Orion Nebula, the Pleiades, and Uranus.
If you've already seen these, feel free to request something new!

The ONU Observatory will be open to the public
on Friday, Aug 31, from 8:00 - 10:00 PM (EDT).
The theme of the event is "The Blue Moon", 
since the Aug 31 full moon will be the second
full moon in August.  A short presentation will
be given around 8:30 PM about the term "blue moon"
and explain that the full moon of Aug 31 does not
actually qualify as a blue moon under the 
original definition. 

The full Moon will be rising dramatically in
the East after the Sun sets around 8:00.
A telescope will be used to project the Moon's 
image onto a screen, while other telescopes 
will be tracking other interesting objects in the sky.

The ONU Observatory will be open to the public on
Saturday evening the night of Aug 11-12 from 10:00 PM
to 1 AM to "see in" the annual Perseid Meteor shower.
The actual peak in shower activity should occur
on the night of Aug 12-13 this year, but the meteors (or 
"shooting stars") are visible over 5 days before and after this 
peak .   The Moon will not be up to interfere with the viewing.  
<br>
<br>
Perseid meteoroids are fragments of the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle 
which are usually smaller than a pea.  The meteors radiate away from 
the constellation Perseus, sometimes exhibiting colors and glowing trains.
<br>
<br>

One does not need a telescope to view the Perseids, but our roll-off 
roof observatory serves as a nice setting  to view them.  Also, the 
telescopes will be in operation  so you can take a break from meteors 
to view planets or deep sky objects.   You are encouraged to bring a 
lawnchair to set up on the fields next to the observatory.  See you there!

A supernova is the explosion of a star.  The light rises over a week's 
time and then slowly fades over months.  It is a rare event in a given 
galaxy, so it is amazing that two have occurred this summer in 
nearby galaxies.
The first occurred in "Whirlpool Nebula" M51 back in May, while the 
second began just last week, Aug 23 in the face-on spiral M101.  
Galaxies are faint, but

"Welcomefest Open House"

<!-- Comet C2017 K2 PanSTARRS may still be visible near Scorpius

Friday, Sept 23, 8:00-10:00 pm -- Public Event
"Autumnal Equinox and Jupiter approaching opposition"
<!-- actual time of equinox is Sept 22, 9:03 PM EDT.
The Moon's phase is 2 days before new (waning crescent)
so deep sky objects, Saturn, Jupiter would be targets.
Jupiter is in opposition on Sept 26.-->

<br><br>
Friday, Oct 21, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Orionid Meteor Shower"
<!--  The Moon phase is waning crescent, so no interference.
	Actual peak of meteor shower is Oct 21-22.
-->

<!--  Friday, Oct 28, 8:00-10:00 pm. - Public Event.
"Observe the crescent Moon" 
-->

<br><br>
Friday, Nov 11, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Uranus at Opposition"

<!-- Actual date of opposition is 11/9. 11/8 is Full Moon, so 
	Moon will rise at 7:30. Uranus will have alt = 32 deg
	at 8:00 while the Moon will only be 4.5 deg high.
	So Uranus should be observable, but there will be
	light pollution as the evening progresses.

<br>
<br>
Friday, Dec 9, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event. 
"Opposition of Mars"
<!-- Actual date of opposition is Dec 8.  Moon is Full on 12/7
so Moon will rise a little after Mars. Mars is way above the Cel Eq.
so it is already 35 deg in altitude at 8:00 pm.  The Moon is 23 degrees
below (East of) Mars. -->

<!-- Sample mynote:
      <div id="mynote">
      <p> Note:
The reason why the early evening sky is so devoid of bright
planets is that they are all in the morning sky.
Try to get up 1-2 hours before sunrise between Jan 20 and Feb 15
to see all 5 bright planets in the sky at once! For the Feb 12 event, we will view the faint planet Uranus 
telescopically, and then Jupiter will rise around 9 pm. </p>

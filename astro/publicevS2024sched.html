Friday, Feb 9,  8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"The Winter Milky Way"
<br> <br>

<!--  
	The Milky Way is our home Galaxy. It is also a swath of light that wraps
	around the sky.  In the summer, the Milky Way runs through constellations like
	Aquila (the Eagle), and Cygnus (the Swan), while in the winter, it runs 
	through Orion and Canis Major (the great dog).  In February, this "Winter
	Milky Way" is crossing the meridian around 9:30 pm, making it a good time
	to explore its treasures with a telescope.
 -->

Friday, Feb 16, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Moon passing through the Pleiades "

  <!--
The first quarter moon will be passing through the Pleiades, or "Seven Sisters"
star cluster just before this evenings event.  This will be a good opportunity
to explore the Moon.  Jupiter and Uranus will also be available for viewing.
	   -->

<br> <br>
Friday, Mar 8, 7:30-9:30 pm. -- Public Event.
"Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks"
<!--
The event starts earlier than usual because the comet is low in the NW 
just after sunset.
Comet's alt=23 deg at 7:30 pm and 19 deg at 8:00 pm.  It is about 6.7 mag.
We will watch it until it disappears behind the observatory's wall.
-->

<br> <br>
Friday, Mar 22, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Mercury at dichotomy"
<!--
	Mercury will appear half lit or in a  first quarter phase.  It
	is also be vbery close to its greatest elongation east of the Sun.
"Spring Star Party!"
this is Mar 20 in Universal Time (Greenwich, England).
 The Moon will be new on Mar 21! 
 Except the Moon can be as far as 5.3 degrees above or below
 the ecliptic. 
-->

<br> <br>
Friday, Apr 5, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Galaxies of Spring"
<!--
One day after new moon - good for finding galaxies. Also mention
the solar hybrid eclipse that was visible in Australia on 4/20/23.
Galaxies like M101, M83, and M87 are well placed for viewing,
along with globular clusters like M3.
--> 
<br> <br> 

Monday, Apr 8, 2:00-4:00 pm. -- Streamed Event. "Total Solar Eclipse!"

<br> <br> 
<!--
Although Total Solar Eclipses happen somewhere on Earth about two times
every three years, they only occur about once in 360 years (on average)
at a given location.  So the town of Ada is lucky to be located right
along the center of the path of totality for this solar eclpse.
A link to the stream will be provided here before the event..

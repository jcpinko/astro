      <h2>Spring 2019 Schedule -- ONU Observatory </h2>
<!--
-->
<br> <br>
Friday, Feb 1,  8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"The Fading Comets of 2019" 
<!--  Wirtanen is fading but may still be the brightest comet of
2019 like it was for 2018.  Comet 38P/Stephan-Oterma passes as close as 11.3 degrees (2/12) to Comet Wirtanen.  It is about 10-11 
magnitude so it can be seen through our telescopes.
Comet 64P/Swift-Gehrels is also fading and around 10th magnitude.
Swift-Gehrels is passing by the Pleiades in February.
 -->
<br> <br>
Friday, Mar 1, 7:00-9:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Greatest elongation of Mercury"
<!-- 
 -->
<br> <br>
Friday, Mar 22, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Vernal Equinox"
<!--
 Have a star party two days after the vernal equinox.  
 The Moon will be waning gibbous and will rise around 10 pm.
 The Moon was full on Mar 20, the same day as the equinox.
 So I could discuss the way the Sun AND Moon should be on
 the celestial equator, rising due east and setting due west.
 Except the Moon can be as far as 5.3 degrees above or below
 the ecliptic. It was 4d10' above the ecliptic.
-->
<br> <br>
Friday, Mar 29, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Supernovae and their remnants"
<!--
Find the brightest supernovae in:
http://www.rochesterastronomy.org/supernova.html
and look at them with the CCDs.  Show previous pictures of SN
in M101, etc.  Show N6949 the most prolific nearby galaxy
(with 10 supernovae).
The Moon is ~21 days old, so dark.
Sunset 6:34 pm.   DST starts before 3/16.
-->
<br> <br>
Friday, Apr 5, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Galaxies of Spring"
<!--
This is a new moon night - good for finding galaxies.
DST starts on Mar 10 so definitely need to start at 9pm EDT (there's
still some twilight).
-->
<br><br>
Friday, May 3, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Eta Aquarid Meteors"
<!--
Eta Aquarids are spread from 4/19-5/28, but the peak is May 5-6.
4/22 Lyrid meteors peak.  Moon is 3 days before new.

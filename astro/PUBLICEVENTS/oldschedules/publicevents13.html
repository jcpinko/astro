Friday, September 6, 8:00 - 10:00 pm. --- "Venus passing the Virgin" Public event.<span style="color: rgb(255, 100, 0);">  </span><br>
 <span style="color: rgb(255, 204, 204);">&nbsp; &nbsp; 
 The planet Venus will be passing close to Spica, the brightest star in
the constellation Virgo ("the virgin").  We will watch it descend towards
the western horizon for the first hour.  There will still be twilight
when we begin at 8 pm, but Venus should be easy to locate if it is clear.  
After it sets, there will still be other objects of interest, including 
Saturn and deep sky objects.  Also, there's no place like the 
ONU Observatory for just watching the sky for satellites and meteors.
 </span>
      <br>
      <br>
Friday, September, 27, 8:00 - 10:00 pm -- "The Andromeda Galaxy"&nbsp; Public event.<br>
 <span style="color: rgb(255, 204, 204);">&nbsp; &nbsp; 
The ONU Astronomy Club invites everyone to attend the next
event at the ONU Observatory.  Our theme is "The Andromeda
Galaxy", and the free event runs from 8 to 10 pm.  Our main target
will be the Andromeda Galaxy, the biggest, brightest
galaxy in the northern sky (after our own Milky Way).
Dr. J. Pinkney, professor of physics and astronomy at ONU,
will give a short presentation on this galaxy around 9 pm,
followed by a Q&A session. <br>

The Moon will be near apogee (it's farthest from the Earth)
tonight, but will not rise until after the event.  That means
it will be easier to see Andromeda and other deep sky objects!
In addition, Venus, Uranus and Neptune will be available. 
<br>
Watch this web page for cancellations on Friday afternoon in 
the event of a cloudy forecast.  
 </span>

Friday, October 18, 8:00 - 10:00 pm. --- "Penumbral Lunar Eclipse"  Public Event 
(during "Experience ONU Day").
</big>
<font style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><big><span style="color: rgb(255, 100, 0);"></span><br>
 <span style="color: rgb(255, 204, 204);">&nbsp; &nbsp; 
You can observe the lunar eclipse from your own backyard
between sunset and about 9:30 pm.  However, penumbral 
eclipses like this produce only a minor, subtle darkening of 
the Moon.  It will just appear like a full moon to most.
 </span>
<br>

      <br>

Friday, November 1, 7:30 - 9:30 pm.  ---  "Maximum Elongation for Venus" Public Event.<span style="color: rgb(255, 100, 0);">  </span><br>
 <span style="color: rgb(255, 204, 204);">&nbsp; &nbsp;
The special occasion is the maximum eastern elongation
configuration for the planet Venus.  The orbit of
Venus fits within the Earth's orbit, and so there is
a limit to how far Venus can appear separated from
the Sun.  That limit is 47 degrees, and on Nov 1,
Venus reaches it for the first time in 8 months.  
Normally, that means easy viewing of Venus, but this time 
it will be close to the horizon after Sunset. <br> 

We will begin earlier than usual so that we can
catch a glimpse of Venus before it sets.  We will
then target Uranus and Neptune, as well as various
double stars and deep-sky objects.  Also, this will be 
the first event in which our new 11-inch telescope 
will be in operation!
<br>
Check this web page on Friday for cancellation
due to a cloudy forecast.

Friday, November 22, 9:00 - 11:00 pm.  ---  "Jupiter is Back!"  Public Event.<span style="color: rgb(255, 100, 0);"></span><br>
 <span style="color: rgb(255, 204, 204);">&nbsp; &nbsp;
This event celebrates the return of
Jupiter to our evening skies.  We are starting
later than usual to ensure that Jupiter is high
enough in the sky for telescopic viewing. (It will
be 10 degrees high by 9:30 pm, EST.)
Come and see the "Galilean moons" and the swirling
cloud decks of Jupiter!  As always, we will view
other solar system and deep sky objects such as
Uranus and the Orion Nebula.

We will also be unveiling our new telescope and
mount with improved GoTo capabilities!
<br>
This event will be cancelled by 3 pm Friday afternoon in
the event of a cloudy forecast.  (Hopefully, we will
get clear skies for a change!)

Friday, December 6, 8:00 - 10:00 pm.  ---&nbsp; "Mira, the Miracle Star" Public Event.<span style="color: rgb(255, 100, 0);"></span><br>
<span style="color: rgb(255, 204, 204);">&nbsp; &nbsp;
We often think of miraculous stars when the holidays
role around, so Omicron Ceti, or "Mira", is an
appropriate theme for a December 4 astronomy event
at the ONU Observatory.
This star was named from the latin word for "wonderful"
because of its dramatic variability. Its brightness 
varies from "too faint to be seen", to "easily visible" over
a 332 day period.  Dr Pinkney will be giving a short
presentation about Mira and other variable stars around 9 pm.
We will be looking at this star through the telescopes
along with other interesting stars, planets (Uranus, Jupiter) and deep
sky objects. 
<br>
<br>
Forecasts predicts snow and clouds until at least 12 am
on Friday, so we may have to cancel.  (Snow covers
the entrance path and can fall off of the roll-off
roof.)  If it happens, bring warm clothes!

<br>
NOTE:&nbsp; Why no event for Comet ISON?<br>
Comet ISON should be in the news in November and December as a
spectacular comet (if it isn't destroyed in its close pass by the
Sun).&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it does not become viewable in the early
evening until about Dec 21.&nbsp; Instead, throughout most of November
and December it will be viewable in the East before sunrise.<br>

Monday, August 12, 9 -12 pm. --- "The Perseid Meteor Shower!"
<span style="color: rgb(255, 100, 0);"> &nbsp; Done</span>
<br>
 <span style="color: rgb(255, 204, 204);">&nbsp; &nbsp; 
Come to the ONU Observatory to see in the Perseid Meteor Shower.
This is usually one of the best annual meteor showers in terms of 
numbers of meteors per hour.  The local conditions will actually
be the best after midnight as the constellation Perseus
(containing the radiant of the shower) rises higher above
the horizon and the Moon sets.  We will have our telescopes
trained on the Moon, Saturn, Venus, and other deep sky objects.

Meteors are grains of cometary material entering the Earth's
atmosphere at 10-80 kilometers per second.  The Perseid meteors
originated in the comet Swift-Tuttle which last visited the
inner solar system in 1992.
<!--
This event will be cancelled if cloudy weather is forecasted.

 <span style="color: rgb(255, 204, 204);">&nbsp; &nbsp; 
Mercury, Venus and Jupiter will be above the NW horizon on this night.
They were actually in their most compact arrangement (conjunction) 
on May 26 when each fit in a 2.5 degree circle.  
Tonight has the advantage that Mercury is higher above the
horizon so far, on its way to a maximum elongation of 24 degrees.
We will follow these planets using portable telescopes as they
set and then focus our attention on Saturn, who continues to 
make a good showing in the SE sky.

During spring evenings, the well-placed constellations are rather unspectacular
and devoid of bright stars.  These constellations, like Cancer and Coma Berenices, 
are actually the best hunting grounds for galaxies.  Galaxies, like our own Milky Way,
are collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter.  We will observe some 
of the brighter galaxies tonight with our telescopes.  Additional targets
will be Jupiter and Comet PanSTARRS.  The comet will be located within 2 degrees
of the Andromeda Galaxy,  the brightest galaxy of Northern hemisphere.

<span style="color: rgb(255, 100, 0);"> --Done.  </span> 
<br>
<small> 
Tonight's event is chosen to coincide with the
peak of the Leonid Meteor Shower.  This annual shower has
periodically produced "storms" of meteor activity, but 
tonight it is only expected to produce 10-15 meteors/hour
for a given viewer.  Meteors are also called "shooting stars".
They are the sand-grain-sized debris of comets that enter
the Earth's atmosphere so quickly that they create a bright
streak of light.  The Leonid meteors originated in the 
Comet Temple-Tuttle.

We will also observe various deep sky objects, the crescent

Friday, December 7, 8:00 - 10:00 pm.  --- "Jupiter at its Brightest" Public Event
<span style="color: rgb(255, 100, 0);"> --Done.  </span> 
<br>
Jupiter recently passed through opposition on December 2.  Opposition is
the configuration in which a planet appears from Earth to be in the opposite direction as the Sun.
This is also the time in which the planet looks the brightest to us because of its full
phase and its proximity to the Earth.  During tonight's event, Jupiter is still
nearly optimal in appearance, and so we will keep it in at least one telescope all
night. In two hours, the planet rotates 1/5 of a full revolution and we will watch
for moving features like the Great Red Spot and shadows cast by its moons.
The view to the unaided eye is also spectacular since Jupiter will be 
embedded in bright winter asterisms like the Pleiades and Orion, and 
less than 5 degrees from the orange star Aldebaran. We plan to keep a live Jupiter
video feed on our wall TV for easy viewing.

Other targets tonight may be the Great Orion Nebula, the Pleiades, and Uranus.
If you've already seen these, feel free to request something new!

The ONU Observatory will be open to the public
on Friday, Aug 31, from 8:00 - 10:00 PM (EDT).
The theme of the event is "The Blue Moon", 
since the Aug 31 full moon will be the second
full moon in August.  A short presentation will
be given around 8:30 PM about the term "blue moon"
and explain that the full moon of Aug 31 does not
actually qualify as a blue moon under the 
original definition. 

The full Moon will be rising dramatically in
the East after the Sun sets around 8:00.
A telescope will be used to project the Moon's 
image onto a screen, while other telescopes 
will be tracking other interesting objects in the sky.

The ONU Observatory will be open to the public on
Saturday evening the night of Aug 11-12 from 10:00 PM
to 1 AM to "see in" the annual Perseid Meteor shower.
The actual peak in shower activity should occur
on the night of Aug 12-13 this year, but the meteors (or 
"shooting stars") are visible over 5 days before and after this 
peak .   The Moon will not be up to interfere with the viewing.  
<br>
<br>
Perseid meteoroids are fragments of the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle 
which are usually smaller than a pea.  The meteors radiate away from 
the constellation Perseus, sometimes exhibiting colors and glowing trains.
<br>
<br>

One does not need a telescope to view the Perseids, but our roll-off 
roof observatory serves as a nice setting  to view them.  Also, the 
telescopes will be in operation  so you can take a break from meteors 
to view planets or deep sky objects.   You are encouraged to bring a 
lawnchair to set up on the fields next to the observatory.  See you there!

A supernova is the explosion of a star.  The light rises over a week's 
time and then slowly fades over months.  It is a rare event in a given 
galaxy, so it is amazing that two have occurred this summer in 
nearby galaxies.
The first occurred in "Whirlpool Nebula" M51 back in May, while the 
second began just last week, Aug 23 in the face-on spiral M101.  
Galaxies are faint, but
we will try to obtain images with our cameras for all to see.  Also,

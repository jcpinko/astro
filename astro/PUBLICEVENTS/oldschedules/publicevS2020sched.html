      <h2>Spring 2020 Schedule -- ONU Observatory </h2>
<!--
-->
Friday, Feb 14,  7:00-9:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Venus, Goddess of Love" 
<!--  It's Valentine's day! So what better time to look at the love-related
objects in astronomy.  The planet Venus is named after the Roman Goddess of
love and it is an easy target for our telescopes during most Spring evenings.
This night also happens to be the Greatest Elongation of Mercury, but it will
be almost set at 7 pm.  Other heart-related objects include Pluto, which
has a heart-shaped region (Regio Tombaugh) discovered in 2015 by New Horizons.
Also, the Heart and Soul nebula is a deep sky object that difficult to see
through the telescope without dark sky conditions.  
 -->
<br> <br>
Friday, Feb 28, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Leap Days and Time"
<!-- 
Saturday, Feb. 29 is the extra day added to the 2020 calendar to
make it a leap year!  What are leap years and why do we need
them?  The astronomical origins of our system of time will be
discussed.
 -->
<br> <br>
Friday, Mar 6, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Moon in the Beehive"
<!--
The gibbous moon will be passing through the beehive.  We'll
take on the challenge of spotting the star cluster with 
the Moon closeby.  We can also observe the Moon and brighter
objects in the winter Milky Way (Orion, etc.).
-->

<br> <br>
Friday, Mar 20, 8:30-10:30 pm. -- Public Event.
"The Vernal Equinox"
<!--
(On Daylight Savings Time.  Sun only 3.5 degrees below horizon at 8 pm EDT.
 There will still be twilight at 8:30 pm EDT.
Have a star party to celebrate the vernal equinox, the start of spring!
The actual moment of equinox is 23:50 EDT on Mar 19, but
this is Mar 20 in Universal Time (Greenwich, England).
 The Moon will be waning crescent (below horizon) heading towards a
conjunction with Mercury on 3/21, and new moon on 3/24.  Jupiter and 
Mars are also in close conjunction, visible in the morning sky.
 So I could discuss the way the Sun (and new Moon and Full Moon) 
 should be close to the celestial equator, rising due east and 
 setting due west.
 Except the Moon can be as far as 5.3 degrees above or below
 the ecliptic. 
-->
<br> <br>
Friday, Mar 27, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Venus at Greatest Elongation"
<!--
The actual date of greatest elongation east is Mar 24.
On that date it has an altitude of 44 degrees at sunset.
The altitude is still about 44 degrees on 3/27, but it is
a little closer to us.  This is a good apparition of Venus
because the ecliptic is nearly verticle.
The Moon is only 3 days old, so we can observe the crescent.
Can also look for Comet PANSTARRS.
-->
<br> <br>
Friday, Apr 17, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Comet C/2017 T2 PANSTARRS"
<!--
Comet C/2017 T2 is expected to be at 8.5th magnitude.  This is not
bright enough to see with the eye, but should be viewable in the
telescopes.
-->
<br> <br>
Friday, Apr 24, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Galaxies of Spring"
<!--
Two days after new moon - good for finding galaxies.
Galaxies like M101, M83, and M87 are well placed for viewing,
along with globular clusters like M3.

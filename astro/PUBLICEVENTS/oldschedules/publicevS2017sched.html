<br> <br>
Friday, Jan 27, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"The ISS flies by Mars and Venus" 
<!--  RISKY: Stellarium showed the ISS passing Mars around 8:24 pm, but
is it accurate?  This night is also New Moon, so a good dark sky for
looking at DSO's like the Orion Nebula.   M31 still visible.
Venus will be as close as 8 degrees from the ISS.  Venus at -4.5 mag,
and ISS at -2.3 mag. Enters Earth's shadow at 8:26:22 after reaching
an altitude of 70 deg.
The heavens-above site predicts that ISS will enter the Earth's
shadow at 8:26:06 and only reach an altitude of 12 deg and 0.0 mag
and not quite reach Mars or Venus!
 -->
<br> <br>
Friday, Feb 17, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Brilliant Venus" 
<!-- 
Venus reaches "Greatest Brilliancy" on Feb 16, but it will be just
about as big and bright on this day.  Plus, Venus, Mars and Uranus
are 2 days away (2/19) from conjunction.
 -->
<br> <br>
Friday, Mar 3, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.&nbsp; "Craters and Maria of the Moon"
<!--
The Moon was New on Feb 26, so it is 5 days old.
Sunset 7:23 pm.  8pm still has twilight but Moon is well placed.
Venus has alt=22 deg at 8pm. Mars has alt=32 deg.
	Feb 3 would also work with the Moon at 48% illum. Venus
and Mars are closer together on Feb 3.
Note: on the next day, Mar 4, the Moon occults Aldebaran.
-->
<br> <br>
Friday,
Mar 17, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Star Formation in Orion"
<!--
DST started on Mar 11 so definitely need to start at 9pm EDT (there's
still some twilight).
Orion transits at 8:20 pm, just before sunset, but it is still high
enough to observe as it heads west from 9-11 pm.
-->
<br><br>
Friday, Mar 31, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event.&nbsp; "Glimpse Mercury"
<!--
Mercury is at Greatest East.Elong. on 4/1/17.  Its elongation at GEE
will be about 19 degrees and it is a good appearance in that the
line from the Sun to Mercury is almost perpendicular to the horizon.
The Moon will be a crescent (20%) in the West and Jupiter will rise
later in the Night.  Hydra near the meridian.
The biggest elongation angle between 2010-2020 is 27.8 deg and
the smallest is 17.9. 
-->
<br> <br>
Friday,
Apr 7, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Jupiter at opposition"
<!--
Jupiter is actually at opposition on April 7.

Spring 2016 Schedule

Friday, Feb 5, 8:00-10:00 pm. - Public Event. "Comet C/2013 US10 Catalina"

The ONU Astronomy Club will be hosting an Astronomy event for the public at ONU Observatory on Friday, Feb 5, from 8:00-10:00 PM. The main attraction is “Comet C/2013 US10 Catalina”. This is the brightest comet in the sky at this time. It is easy to see in a telescope, but not quite bright enough to see with the unaided eye. Comets have a nucleus made of mostly water ice, dark organic minerals and other frozen gases. The nucleus of Comet Catalina is estimated to be 4-20 km across, and so is too small to resolve. However, when comets approach the Sun the surface ices turn into gases and they form a huge coma (halo) and tails. This comet is one of many objects discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey , hence the name. Other targets for this evening include the Great Orion Nebula and Jupiter.
This event was CANCELLED.

Friday, Feb 12, 8:00-10:00 pm. - Public Event. "Where Have the Bright Planets Gone?"
The ONU Astronomy Club will be hosting an Astronomy event for the public at ONU Observatory on Friday, Feb 12, from 8:00-10:00 PM. The event is called "Where Have the Bright Planets Gone?". This is referring to the absence of bright planets in the early evening sky. Most "earlybirds" know the answer to the question: the planets are visible just before sunrise! Between Jan 28 and Feb 6, the Moon joined the morning planets, passing successively by Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus and Mercury. Moreover, the planets were all in a line. Is this a rare occurrence? Is it a "harmonic convergence" that will cause a dangerous imbalance in gravity? No. The planets orbit the Sun in about the same orbital plane as the Earth, so it is normal for them to appear on a line. Also, the planets will "gang up" on one side of the sky every few decades or so. The 5 visible planets were all above the horizon back in 2005, and in 1962, they were all within 17 degrees of each other along with the Sun and the Moon.

So what to observe on Feb 12? The Moon will be a crescent close to Uranus in the Western sky. We can also look at the deep sky objects of the winter Milky Way, like the wispy Great Orion Nebula. By 9:15, massive Jupiter will have risen high enough to view. Finally, we can still get a look at Comet Catalina as it flies away from the Earth and Sun.

This event was CANCELLED.

Note: We will not hold a special event for the viewing of the planets in the morning sky. But we encourage you to get up 1 hour before sunrise between Jan 20 and Feb 15 to see all 5 bright planets in the sky at once!

Friday, Mar 11, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event.  "Jupiter's Shrinking Red Spot"
The ONU Astronomy Club will be hosting an Astronomy event for the public at ONU Observatory on Friday, March 11, from 9:00-11:00 PM. The main attraction is Jupiter, the biggest planet in the solar system. Jupiter makes its closest approach to the Earth this year on March 8, so it looks especially big and bright in the sky. It is famous for its Great Red Spot (GRS), a giant, anti-cyclonic storm in its southern hemisphere that has lasted for well over one hundreds years. Astronomers have noted for nearly as long that the spot has been shrinking. It used to be 3 Earth's across and now it is only two. Also, it become more deep red in color in 2014. If the shrinking continues at recent rates, it will be gone in 50 years! Come and see Jupiter live through the eyepiece and on the TV with our live webcam feed. (And we have enough telescopes to look at other objects as well.) A brief slide presentation about Jupiter is planned for 10 pm.

This event was a success.


Friday, Apr 1, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event.  "Galaxies of Spring"
Visit the ONU Observatory on Friday, April 1, between 9 and 11 pm for the "Galaxies of Spring", a free, public event. This time of spring is ideal for the observation of galaxies. The most nearby groupings of galaxies, like the Virgo Cluster and the Leo Group, are conveniently placed in the sky during the night. Galaxies are relatively faint, so it is good that the Moon will be below the horizon during the event. A Powerpoint presentation will be given about galaxies. Despite the galaxy theme, we will also observe some brighter deep sky objects and the planet Jupiter.
This event was CANCELLED.


Friday, Apr 15, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event.  "Craters and Maria of the Moon"
The ONU Astronomy Club will be hosting "Craters and Maria of the Moon" on Friday, April 15, from 9-11 pm at the ONU Observatory. This event is free and open to the public. The main attraction will be the Moon, just past first quarter in its waxing gibbous phase. Sure, anyone can look up and see the Moon, but a telescope reveals a great deal of fascinating detail. Come and see the highlands, the lowlands, rilles, mountains, and a huge variety of craters. You might learn a thing or two, like that "Maria" isn't just a song from West Side Story. It's also the plural of "mare" which is latin for "sea". There are no large bodies of water on the Moon, but the giant, old craters that filled in with dark basalt look like oceans. Jupiter and its "Galilean Moons" will also be prime targets.
This event was a success.

Monday, May 9,  9:00-11:00 AM. -- Public Event.  "Mercury transits the Sun! (7:15am-2:30 pm)"
On Monday, May 9, the ONU Observatory will be open to the public from 9:00 to 11:00 am to view the transit of Mercury across the Sun. This is when Mercury travels between the Earth and Sun (inferior conjunction) so that it appears as a tiny, dark dot on the Sun. We have several ways to view the Sun without hurting our eyes, including a new, specialized solar telescope that utilizes a red, narrowband filter. The views of the Sun alone are worth the trip, but a transit is a somewhat rare event. The last Mercury transit was in 2006 and the next will be in 2019. Mercury transits occur only in May and November, with November transits twice as frequent. The May transits are easier to observe since Mercury appears a little larger (12 vs 10 arcseconds), and the transit tends to last longer. The next May transit is in 2049!
If the weather threatens to be excessively cloudy, we will post a cancellation by Sunday evening, May 8, 9 pm.

Our event was clouded out. Hope you saw it online!

<br> <br>
Friday, Sept 4, 8:30-10:30 pm. -- Public Event.
"Saturn and Mercury setting early"
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote2">
On Friday, September 4, the ONU Observatory will be
open to the public from 8:30-10:30 pm for our first event
of the Fall. We will be trying to get views of Saturn and Mercury
before they are gone for the Fall.
First, Saturn is normally an easy target, but will be rather low in the
southwestern sky and become out of reach by about 10:20 pm.
It will be out of reach in the months to come, so come to
this event if you have never seen the rings of Saturn!
Second, Mercury happens to be in its "greatest eastern elongation"
configuration on September 4. This means it appears far (27.1 degrees)
from the Sun. However, its direction from the Sun puts it right
near the horizon at the start of the event.
Fortunately, blue Neptune will be a better sport than Mercury. It
had it's opposition on September 1, so it rises early in the evening
and will be observable by 9:15 pm.
<br>

"Elusive planets: Mercury, Neptune, and Pluto"
Tuesday, Sept 1, 2015 is the opposition of Neptune.
Friday, Sept 4, 2015 is the GEE of Mercury (27 deg from W horiz.).

Sunday, Sept 27, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Total Lunar Eclipse"
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote2">
Come by the ONU Observatory between 9 and 11 pm on Sunday,
September 27 to enjoy the Total Lunar Eclipse!  This is
when the shadow of the Earth covers the Moon.  The Moon
will appear coppery orange because of the light it still
receives through the Earth's atmosphere.  This will also be
a "supermoon" because the Moon will be close to the Earth.
The Moon first contacts the umbra (the dark part of Earth's shadow)
at 9:07 pm.  It will be completely emerged from 10:11-11:23 pm,
with maximum eclipse at 10:47 pm,
and will finally exit the umbra at 12:27 am.  (We will not be open
until the end of totality.)  Although the event can be seen
with the naked eye, we will also be looking at
other targets with our telescopes, such as Uranus and Neptune.
</div>
<div class="itson">
This event was a success despite clouds! <br>
However, the forecast calls for mostly cloudy skies and even
a small chance of showers.  If it is raining, the observatory
roof will be closed.
We will keep watching for views through the clouds from 9-11 pm.
Dr. Pinkney will be present to answer questions.

This will also be a "supermoon" because of perihelion.
The Moon begins totality at 10:11 EDT and ends totality at 11:23 EDT
(U2 and U3).

Friday, Oct 9, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.&nbsp; "Tears from the Dragon"
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote2">
ONU Physics and Astronomy present "Tears from the Dragon".
The ONU Observatory will be open from 8-10 pm to celebrate an interesting
meteor shower. The Draconid meteor shower peaks on Oct 9
and appears to emanate from the head of Draco, the dragon.
Its hourly rate is notoriously fickle: less
than 10 per hour on most years, but on some years (1933, 1946,
and 2011) the rate soared to 6000 meteors per hour.
This shower occurs because the Earth crosses the orbital
path of Comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner.
Unlike most showers, the Draconids tend to be strongest
before midnight. The Moon is also working in our favour
since it rises after midnight as a waning crescent.
<br>
<br>
Even if the Draconids don't produce a show, the Orionids
(lasting Oct 4 - Nov 14) will also contribute occasional
meteors (or "falling stars") to the display.
Plus, we will train our telescopes on Uranus, which
is closest to Earth on October 11, along with other star clusters
and galaxies.
(The originally scheduled "Comet Catalina Brightens" is
postponed for a later date.)

Friday, Oct 16, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.&nbsp; "The Andromeda Galaxy"
<!-- Moon 4 days old, but far from M31,M33, Perseus, etc in the sky. -->
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote2">
The ONU Astronomy Club invites everyone to attend the next
event at the ONU Observatory.  Our theme is "The Andromeda
Galaxy", and the free event runs from 8 to 10 pm.  Our main target
will be the Andromeda Galaxy, the biggest, brightest
galaxy in the northern sky (after our own Milky Way).
Dr. J. Pinkney, professor of physics and astronomy at ONU,
will give a short presentation on this galaxy around 9 pm,
followed by a Q&A session.
<br>
<br>

The Moon will be a thin crescent next to Saturn
and setting in the west around 8:50 pm.
Without the moonlight, the visibility of Andromeda
(and a host of other deep sky objects) will improve.
Expect some meteors from the Orionid meteor shower,
which peaks on October 21.
In addition, Uranus and Neptune will be available
for viewing.
<br>
<div class="itson">
The event went well.
</div>
<div class="mynote">
<p> Note:
On the morning of Wednesday, October 28, there will be a triple
conjunction of Venus, Jupiter, and Mars in the eastern sky.
The three planets will form a tight, 1-degree triangle.  There
will be no observatory event for this, but it is an easy
event to enjoy with the naked eye.

Friday, October 30, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.&nbsp; "Halloween and the Moon"
<!--  THe Full Moon falls on Tues, Oct 27, but it will still be bright -->
<!--
The Taurid meteor shower peaks on the night of Nov 5-6.
-->
<div class="mynote2">
On Friday, October 30, 8-10 pm, ONU Physics and Astronomy
invites you to our special observance of "Halloween
and the Moon". The word "lunacy" comes from an old
superstition that the full Moon causes crazy behavior
in people (AKA "lunatics"). Although technically 3 days
past full, this Friday's Moon will still rise in the East
big and bright enough to raise some goosebumps. Visitors are
more than justified in wearing a costume to this event:
we will give candy and glow products to those who dress up!
<br>
<br>
The most exciting space phenomenon occurring this Friday
is the passage of a 400 meter wide asteroid called 2015 TB125.
It will be at closest approach (a little over 300,000 miles)
on 1 pm EDT on October 31. Unfortunately, it will not be viewable
by telescope until after midnight, but we will display it's
current position on a monitor. This body poses no threat
to us. What makes it "scary" is that it wasn't discovered
until October 20, 2015 -- what other undiscovered meteoroids
could now be on a collision course with Earth? (Insert your
maniacal laugh here.)
<br>
<br>
In addition to the Moon, we will be pointing telescopes at
Neptune and Uranus, double stars and deep sky objects.
Meteors from the upcoming Taurid or the fading Orionid meteor
showers may also be seen by the lucky visitor as they stand
listening to our sci-fi/horror movie trailers.
<br>

The event was held despite cloudy skies.  We watched a laser
light show and movies on a new projector screen.

Friday, November 13, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.  "What we've learned
of Pluto."
<!--
The Leonid meteor shower peaks on the night of Nov 17-18.
-->
<br> <br>
<!--
<div class="mynote2">
The ONU Astronomy Club invites everyone to attend the next
event at the ONU Observatory.  To celebrate the success of
the "New Horizons" spacecraft reaching Pluto, there will
be a 15 minute presentation of "What we have learned about Pluto".
Starting around 9 pm, Dr. Pinkney will show the images from
New Horizons which far surpass the previous best images
from Hubble.

Pluto is too faint to be seen through our telescopes, so we
will be targetting Uranus, Neptune, deep sky objects, and the
comet C/2014 S2 PANSTARRS.  In addition, two meteor showers
will be occurring: the Taurids (which produces occasional
bright "fireballs") and the Leonids (which peaks the night
of Nov 17).  So whether your looking through the eyepiece
or directly at the sky, some impressive views await you.

Friday, December 11,&nbsp; 8:00-10:00
pm. -- Public Event.&nbsp; "The Geminid Meteor Shower"
<br> <br>
<!--
<div class="mynote2">
The ONU Observatory will be open to the public on
Friday, Dec 11, from 8:00-10:00 PM.  The event is chosen
to coincide with the peak of 3 meteor showers, the most prominent being
the Geminid Meteor Shower.  This annual shower actually peaks on Dec 14,
but has a 6 day duration.  Combined with the other showers, we expect
20 to 40 meteors per hour.  Meteors are also called "falling stars".  They
are the sand-grain-sized debris of comets that enter the Earth's atmosphere
so quickly that they create a bright streak of light.  The Geminid particles
originated in Icarus, a burnt out comet now considered to be a near-Earth
Asteroid.
Although one does not need telescopes to see meteors, the telescopes will be
turned on and tracking various deep sky objects, and planets like Uranus
and Neptune.
<br>
</div>
<div class="cancel">
This event is CANCELLED. (Clouds expected to increase to 90% by 9pm.)
But look for the Geminids on Tuesday, 12/15, when it should be clear!
</div>
<!--
  The Geminid meteor shower peaks on the night of Dec 13.
  From http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/ :
Dec. 10 Monocerids: Radiant - near Gemini. 12 per hour.
Dec. 11 Sigma Hydrids: Radiant - near Head. 12 per hour, fast.
Dec. 14 Geminids: Radiant - near Castor. 60 per hour, many bright,
white but few trails. Icarus, the Earth-crossing astroid seems to be the
parent. Duration-6 days.

<!--

<br> <br>
Sunday, Aug 25,  8:30-9:30 pm. -- ONU Event.
"Welcomefest Meet-n-greet" 
<br> <br>
Friday, Sept 20,  9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Fall Star Party" 
<!--  
The autumnal equinox is right around the corner, on Sept 23.
If the clouds stay away, this is a perfect night for a star party
because Jupiter and Saturn are still easy
targets for the telescope, and deep sky objects will be easier
to find with the Moon gone (it's a new moon).  The comet C/2018 W2 Africano should
also be visible in a telescope and will be located in Andromeda.
 -->
<br> <br>
Friday, Oct 4, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Moon between Saturn and Jupiter"
<!-- 
The 1st quarter moon will be on a line between Saturn and Jupiter.
This will be a great night for inspecting all three with our telescopes.
The comet C/2018 W2 Africano will be passing about 2 degrees 
away from the planet Neptune.
 -->
<br> <br>
Friday, Oct 25, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Blue planets in opposition"
<!--
 The blue-green planet Uranus will be reach opposition tonight, while
blue Neptune reaches opposition on Sept. 9, 2019.  This mean that
both planets are near their optimum observability; they rise
around sunset and are as close to the Earth as they get.
-->
<br> <br>
Monday, Nov 11, 10:00am -12:00 pm. -- Daytime Public Event.
"The transit of Mercury across the Sun"
<!--
This will be one of 14 transits of Mercury in the 21st century.
A transit is when an inferior planet like Mercury or Venus
passes between the Earth and the Sun thereby appearing as
a black dot on the Sun.

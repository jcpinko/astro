Friday, Feb 9,  8:00-10:00 pm. - Public Event.
"The Winter Milky Way"
<br> <br>
-->

<!--  
	The Milky Way is our home Galaxy. It is also a swath of light that wraps
	around the sky.  In the summer, the Milky Way runs through constellations like
	Aquila (the Eagle), and Cygnus (the Swan), while in the winter, it runs 
	through Orion and Canis Major (the great dog).  In February, this "Winter
	Milky Way" is crossing the meridian around 9:30 pm, making it a good time
	to explore its treasures with a telescope.
 -->

Friday, Feb 13, 7:00-9:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Jupiter Divides the Twins" 

  <!--
Jupiter is well placed for viewing after the Jan 10 opposition.  It happens
to be in the middle of the constellation Gemini, nicely dividing the twins
Castor and Pollux.
 Waning gibbous Moon rises late.  Saturn, Mercury are up at 7pm.
* The night before Polar Preview 1.
	   -->

<br> <br>
Friday, Mar 6, 7:30-9:30 pm. -- Public Event.
"Comets in the Western Sky"
<!--
Comet C/2024 E1 (Wierzchos) is fading from 7.2 to 10.0 in March.  Should
be going through Sculptor and/or Cetus.
Comet C/2026 A1 (MAPS) is on its way towards perihelion on Apr 4/5.
It's expected to pass as close as 487,000 mi from Sun's surface.
It should appear about 11.5 degrees below Wierzchos in Cetus.
-->

<br> <br>
Friday, Mar 20, 8:30-10:30 pm. -- Public Event. 
"Spring Equinox Star Party"
<!--
8:30 still has twilight, but the crescent Moon and Venus can be
pointed out above the Western horizon and Jupiter is bright enough
to find.
Comet Wierzchos will be in Taurus at ~9th mag. Comet MAPS will probably
be too low in the twilight to see (approaching Venus).
-->

<br> <br>
Friday, Apr 10, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Galaxies of Spring"
<!--
	Leo reaches the meridian at 9:50 pm.  Jupiter is still in Gemini.
Galaxies like M101, M51, M64, M66, M87, and NGC 3115 are well placed for viewing,
along with globular clusters like M3.

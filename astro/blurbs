The ONU Astronomy Club invites you to visit the ONU
Observatory on Friday, February 15 for "Close call Friday: Near 
Earth Asteroids".  On this date, an asteroid about 45 meters
across will come within 18,000 miles of the Earth -- closer 
than some of our geosynchronous satellites.  The asteroid is 
called "2012 DA14" and it would explode with the energy 
of 2.4 megatons of TNT if it were to impact the Earth.
Fortunately, astronomers are confident that this rock will miss us.
Nevertheless, asteroids will be the theme of this event.
Although we will not be able to see 2012 DA14 from OH,
we will look at other asteroids, along with telescopic favorites
like Jupiter.  Powerpoint slides will be presented around
9 PM about asteroids and the threat they pose to Earth.

This event will be canceled in the event of cloudy weather.  Check this

For 2/21/14:

Ada and the surrounding communities are invited to the 
ONU Observatory on Friday, February 21 from 8-10 pm for 
"Star Formation in Orion".  One of the most frequently studied 
and nearby stellar nurseries is in the beautiful constellation Orion.
It is called the "Orion Nebula" and it is one of the easiest 
nebulosities to see with the telescope.  Since Orion is nicely 
centered above the southern horizon at 8pm on this moonless evening, 
star formation will be our theme.  There will be a short presentation 
and Q&A on this theme around 9 pm.  Jupiter and its moons will also 
be a target for our telescopes.  
NEW: the observatory has replaced it's 6-inch telescope with
a better, 11-inch telescope.

This event will be canceled in the event of cloudy weather or
excessive snow on the roll-off roof.  Check this
web site on the afternoon before the event for cancellations:

------------------------------------------------------------------

For 10/17/14

Everyone is invited to the ONU Observatory on Friday, October 17 
from 8-10 pm for "The Opposition of Uranus".  The planet Uranus 
reached opposition on Tuesday, October 7.  On that day, it was
opposite the Sun in the sky and at about its closest approach
to Earth.  October 17 will be a good night
to observe Uranus; in the days since opposition it has become
more well-placed for observing in the early evening.
Neptune reached opposition on 8/29 so it will also be well
placed for observing.  These planets are not bright enough
to be seen with the naked eye but look like bluish spheres in
the telescopes.  Come and see these distant, gas giants and
you may even see their brightest Moons (Ariel and Triton).
	As a bonus, we will try to glimpse Comet Siding Spring
on its way to encounter Mars on October 19!  Mars
will be best visible at the beginning of our event since it
sets around 9:50 pm.

This event will be canceled in the event of cloudy weather.

For 10/16/15

Friday, Oct 16, 8:00 - 10:00 pm -- "The Andromeda Galaxy" 

The ONU Astronomy Club invites everyone to attend the next
event at the ONU Observatory.  Our theme is "The Andromeda
Galaxy", and the free event runs from 8 to 10 pm.  Our main target
will be the Andromeda Galaxy, the biggest, brightest
galaxy in the northern sky (after our own Milky Way).
Dr. J. Pinkney, professor of physics and astronomy at ONU,
will give a short presentation on this galaxy around 9 pm,
followed by a Q&A session. 

The Moon will be a thin crescent next to Saturn
and setting in the west around 8:50 pm.
Without the moonlight, the visibility of Andromeda 
(and a host of other deep sky objects) will improve.
Expect some meteors from the Orionid meteor shower, 
which peaks on October 21.
In addition, Uranus and Neptune will be available 
for viewing.

Watch this web page for cancellations on Friday afternoon in
the event of a cloudy forecast.

For 8/27/16

Saturday, Aug 27, 6:00-7:00 pm -- "Jupiter and Venus together"

The ONU Observatory will have its first Public Event of the
fall during the daytime: 6:00-7:00 pm on Saturday, Aug 27.
It is an amazing conjunction of Jupiter and Venus in which they 
will pass as close as 1/15 
of a degree from one another!  Daytime observations of the
brightest planets and stars is possible with some of the telescopes 
we have on mounts at the ONU Observatory.  We will not be able
to "stargaze" or observe "deep sky" objects with the Sun up.
However, we can take a look at the Sun itself with our new
solar telescope!  This is a small, refractor telescope that
only lets through a narrow range of red wavelengths.  It allows
us to see solar prominances, not just sunspots!  So drop by
during the dinner hour and see things that very few people
have seen: live solar prominances, and Jupiter and Venus in
the blue sky of daytime.
 
Our Public Events are free to the public.
Watch our web page for cancellations by 2 pm on
Saturday afternoon in the event of a cloudy forecast:

Friday, January 27, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- "The ISS flies by Mars and Venus" 

The ONU Observatory will be open to the public from
8 - 10 pm on Friday, January 27, 2017 for our first event
of the Spring semester.  It is entitled "The ISS flies
by Mars and Venus".  Around 8:24 pm, EST, the ISS
(International Space Station) will rise in the southwest
and pass by Venus and Mars as seen from Ada, OH.  The
brightness of the ISS will only be rivaled by Venus.
After that passage, we will observe Mars and Venus as well
as deep sky objects using our many telescopes.

Our events are free to the public.  Check here for maps

Friday, Feb 17, 8:00-10:00 pm -- "Brilliant Venus"

The ONU Observatory will be open to the public from
8 - 10 pm on Friday, February 17, 2017 for our 
"Brilliant Venus" event.
Have you noticed Venus getting brighter in the western
sky after sunset?  It reaches its "maximum brilliancy" on
Feb 16, and we will be celebrating this on our Friday 
public event.  Venus will greatly outshine nearby Mars and
Uranus.  Through the telescope, you will discern it's crescent
phase.  Maximum brilliancy is the moment when the illuminated
part of Venus presents to us the largest solid angle (an angular area).
This actually occurs a little while after the date of maximum 
brightness, and before Venus is closest to the Earth.
At any rate, Venus is cool ... or rather, hot!  At 860 degrees
F, it is hot enough to melt lead and its clouds contain
sulfuric acid.  In addition to viewing Venus, Mars and Uranus,
we can observe deep sky objects like the Great Orion Nebula
without interference by moonlight.

[Maximum brilliancy happens (according to Stellarium) when
elongation ~39.7 degrees, and phase=27% illumination

Friday, Mar 3, 8:00-10:00 pm -- "Craters and Maria of the Moon"

The ONU Astronomy Club welcomes you to the ONU 
Observatory on Friday, March 3, 2017 for our
"Craters and Maria of the Moon" event.  Stop by
any time between 8 and 10 pm to look through our
telescopes or ask questions about the night sky.
On this night, the crescent Moon will be high in the
southwest, well placed for viewing.  The phase is
a good one for seeing interesting lunar features
such as the Posidonius Crater with its fissures, and
Mare Tranquillitatus, where Apollo 11 landed.
Other targets will include Venus, Mars and deep
sky objects.

For 3/17/17:
Friday, Mar 17, 9:00-11:00 pm -- "Star formation in Orion"

Ada and the surrounding communities are invited to the
ONU Observatory on Friday, March 17 from 9-11 pm for
"Star Formation in Orion".  It may seem like the stars are
eternal, but they do eventually die out.  They are also
born hundreds at a time out of giant clouds of gas and dust.
One of the most frequently studied
and nearby "stellar nurseries" is in the constellation Orion.
It is called the "Orion Nebula" and it is one of the easiest
nebulosities to see with a telescope.  
The Orion Nebula will be well-placed in the sky for observing
during our event.  There will also be a short presentation 
about star formation showing beautiful images of the Orion 
Nebula and other sites of star formation.

2017
For 4/21/17:
Ada and the surrounding communities are invited to the
ONU Observatory on Friday, April 21 from 9-11 pm
for "The Galaxies of Spring".  Galaxies are a swirling collection
of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter.  They are generally
difficult to see with telescopes because they are
so far away and faint.  During this time of the year, however,
the closest concentrations of galaxies are positioned
high in the sky by midnight.  We will be targeting such
galaxies as M66 in Leo and the "Black eye galaxy" in
Coma Berenices for observation with the telescopes.
By sheer luck, at 9:47 pm, an Iridium satellite is scheduled to flare
brightly just as it passes into Coma Berenices; a dot as bright
as Venus will momentarily mark our Milky Way's North Galactic
Pole!   So come and witness the wonders of the deep sky
as you learn about extragalactic astronomy!

This event will be canceled in the event of cloudy weather.

10/20/17:
The ONU Observatory will be open to the public on Friday,
October 20, from 8-10 pm.  The event is called "The Orionid
Meteors and Comet C/2017 O1".  The Orionid meteor shower
is an annual shower which will peak after midnight of 
October 20 when there will be about 20 meteors per hour
under optimum conditions.  A visitor will not experience
optimum conditions, but may still notice a few meteors
streaming out of Orion.  Telescopes do not help you to tally
more meteors, but they do help you see ... comets!  And
there is a comet, "C/2017 O1 ASASSN", that will be in the
northern sky Friday night.  It is a challenge to see, even
through a telescope, so we will display an image on a TV screen.  
The name comes from the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae,
run by OSU.  Meteors are often mistakenly referred to as "comets".
In fact, meteors are tiny fragments shed by old comets that are
"burning up" in Earth's atmosphere.  The Orionid meteors actually
originate in the famous Comet Halley.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

2017
11/15/17:
Weather allowing, the ONU Observatory will be open to the 
public on Friday, November 17, from 8-10 pm.
The event is called "The Leonid Meteor Shower".  This shower
is strongest on the mornings of Nov 17 and 18 every year.
It is famous for its occasional outbursts, called "meteor storms"
roughly every 33 years.  The last Leonid storm was in 2001 which
produced thousands of meteors per hour.  The strongest showing
known was in 1833, when about 100,000 meteors fell per hour.
So we don't expect much from the 2017 storm, perhaps 15 meteors
per hour, but there are other reasons to watch the sky.  The
Taurid meteor shower overlaps the Leonids producing fewer meteors
but more fireballs (very bright meteors) and distinctly slower
meteors.  In addition, the planets Neptune and Uranus will be
up.

2/9/18: -"The International Space Station passes high" 

The ONU Observatory will be open to the public on Friday, Feb 9
from 7-9 pm, weather permitting.  On this evening, the ISS is
scheduled to pass over Ohio at  7:49 pm such that it will 
reach 66 degrees above the horizon.  That is only 24 degrees
from the point directly overhead (the zenith)!  
The ISS is the largest, manned, artificial satellite and
so it will be about as bright as Venus, outshining all of the stars 
in the sky.
That impressive sight only lasts a few minutes.  The rest of
the night, we will be observing deep-sky objects with the 
telescopes under a moonless sky.

This event will be canceled in the event of cloudy or icy weather.

For 3/9/18:  "Stardeath: supernovae and their remnants"

Ada and the surrounding communities are invited to the
ONU Observatory on Friday, March 9 from 8-10 pm for
"Stardeath: supernovae and their remnants".
Stars meet their death in a variety of ways which depends mostly
on their mass.  The most massive
stars end in spectacular explosions called supernovae.  Those which
occur in our Milky Way galaxy can outshine Venus for a month or more.
They leave behind expanding gas clouds which glow faintly in visible
wavelengths for thousands of years.  It turns out that SNRs (supernova
remnants) would seem much brighter if our eyes saw in radio or x-rays.
We will take a look at a few SNRs that are visible in a telescope: the
Crab Nebula and the Jellyfish Nebula.  We may also glimpse the galaxy
NGC 3941 currently undergoing a supernova.  Low to middleweight
stars like the Sun are not quite as explosive in death, but they
still "puff out" their outer shells to form a beautiful "planetary nebula".  
We will also observe examples of these nebulae including the "Cat's 
Eye Nebula" and the "Little Dumbbell".   

This event will be canceled if excessively cloudy skies are in the forecast.

Monday, July 30, 9:30-11 pm. "Opposition of Mars"

The ONU Observatory will be open to the public on Monday, July 30 from 9:30-11 pm, weather permitting. On this date, Mars will be just 3 days passed opposition. ``Opposition" is the planetary configuration in which the planet appears in the opposite direction as the Sun from the Earth's perspective. It is also the time of closest approach to the Earth, making Mars look bigger and brighter than usual. This will be the closest we've come to Mars since the 2003 opposition (but that was the closest in about 60,000 years). At 9:30 pm Mars will not quite be high enough to see with the telescopes, but we will observe Venus, Jupiter and Saturn until Mars rises into view. (We chose July 30 instead of July 27 because the Full Moon interferes with our view of Mars on the 27th. )

Friday, Sept 21, 8-10 pm. "Autumnal Equinox"

The ONU Observatory will be open to the public on Friday, September 21
from 8-10 pm to observe the Autumnal Equinox, or the beginning
of Fall.  The precise time of the equinox is September 22, 9:54 pm EDT.
However, the phenomena will be nearly the same on Sept 21.
This is one of the two equinoxes (the other in March) when you expect to 
see length of night and day being nearly equal, and 
the Sun setting due West on the horizon.
Dr. Pinkney will demonstrate using a planetarium program
how the Sun crosses the celestial equator on Sept 22.
Also, the planets Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars will be well positioned for
observing with the telescopes.

Firday, Oct. 12, 8-10 pm. "Observe the Crescent Moon"

The ONU Astronomy Club welcomes you to the ONU
Observatory on Friday, Oct 12, 2018 for our
"Observe the Crescent Moon" event.  Stop by
any time between 8 and 10 pm to look through our
telescopes or ask questions about the night sky.
On this night, the Moon will be in a waxing crescent phase,
which is usually a good time to look at lunar craters and
mountains.  In the fall, however, the waxing crescent is
far below the celestial equator which keeps it low to the
southwest horizon.  It will begin at a low altitude of 15 
degrees, and set around 9:30 pm.   But do not despair!  
There will be plenty of targets to look at after the Moon 
descends: Mars, Saturn, Uranus, double stars and deep sky objects.

% The Apollo 11 landing site is in shadow in Mare Tranquillitatus 
% Mars will show a gibbous phase with the major volcanoes crossing
% the terminator and Valles Marineris well-centered.
% Moon is only 14deg above horizon at 8pm!

Friday, Dec 7, 8-10 pm "Comet Wirtanen"

The ONU Astronomy Club welcomes Ada and the surrounding communities
to the ONU Observatory on Friday, Dec 7, for our "Comet Wirtanen" 
event.  We have been clouded out on previous events but the current
forecast for Friday suggests less than 40% cloudcover -- we may be
able to get a glimpse of the brightest comet of 2018!  This comet is making
a great appearance because it will be passing so close to
the Earth (12 million km, or about 1/13 of the distance to the Sun).
Also, it will be well placed for viewing above the southern horizon.
It is expected to reach naked eye brightness by Dec. 16, the day
of closest approach, but on Dec 7 we will need our telescopes and 
binoculars to view it.  We will take color photographs 
of the comet which should make its green hue easier to see.
Not far from Comet Wirtanen in the sky are Uranus, the 
Pleiades, and Mars, which we can also observe.

The weather should be below freezing, so dress warmly. The
observatory does have a heated room in case you get chilled.

Friday, Mar 1, 7-9 pm "Greatest Elongation of Mercury"

The ONU Astronomy Club welcomes Ada and the surrounding communities
to the ONU Observatory on Friday, March 1, for our "Greatest Elongation
of Mercury"  event.  The word "Elongation" refers to the angular
separation between Mercury and the Sun.  Since Mercury's orbit remains 
closer to the Sun than the Earth, it can never be farther than
about 28 degrees from the Sun.  This week, Mercury will be at
its maximum elongation on the east side of the Sun.  It's elongation
will actually be about 18.1 degrees since it will be near the
perihelion (nearest point to the Sun) of its orbit.
We will open the observatory relatively early at 7 pm in order to
catch Mercury before it sets in the West.  After setting, there
will still be other wondrous sites to see such as Mars and the 
stars of the winter Milky Way.

2019
Friday, Mar 22, 9-11 pm. "Super Worm Equinox Moon"

The ONU Observatory will be open to the public on Friday, March 22,
from 9-11 pm to observe the vernal equinox, or the beginning
of Spring.  The precise time of the equinox is March 20, 5:58 pm EDT,
but the position of the Sun will be nearly the same on March 22.
Coincidentally, a full Moon occurs within 4 hours of the equinox this year.  
It has been dubbed the "Super Worm Equinox Moon".
The "Super" refers to the close proximity of the Moon (perigee), while the
"Worm" refers to the way earthworms start appearing in late March!
Expect the Moon to rise nearly due east when the Sun is setting 
due west on March 20.
On Friday, March 22, we'll see the (nearly) full Moon rise around
10 pm.  Prior to that, the sky will be dark enough to enjoy
exploring the winter Milky Way.
This is one of the two equinoxes (the other in September) when you 
expect to see the length of night and day being nearly equal. 
Dr. Pinkney will demonstrate the vernal equinox and full moon
using a planetarium program.

"Eta Aquarid Meteors" because the peak of the Eta Aquarid
annual meteor shower happens soon after (May 5).  The meteor 
activity has a broad peak so some are expected on May 3, 
especially after the constellation Aquarius rises at 3:30 am.  
The shower is named after the closest bright star to the
radiant of the shower.  The radiant is the point from which
the meteors appear to eminate.   The moon will be one day
before its new phase, ideal for meteor-watching.  This
phase also favors the viewing of deep-sky objects with the
telescopes.  The Eta Aquarid meteor particles were produced long 
ago by Halley's comet.  The meteor is seen when these pea-sized
particles hit Earth's atmosphere at high speeds.  The Eta
Aquarids produce some of the fastest meteors at about 70 km/s
(150,000 mph).

This event will be cancelled in the event of cloudy weather.

For 9/20/19:
Friday, Sept 20, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Fall Star Party"

Friday, September 20 is just three nights before this year's autumnal 
equinox -- when the days are roughly equally divided into light and dark 
and fall is right around the corner. With the Moon in it's new phase, 
this will be a great night for observing the planets and deep sky objects. 
A brightening comet called C/2018 W2 Africano will be passing through 
the constellation Andromeda and bright enough to be an easy telescopic 
target. The planets Jupiter and Saturn will be well placed in the southern 
sky. Come and see the rings of Saturn, the great red spot of Jupiter, and 
Comet Africano a week before it's predicted peak brightness. All during 
our "Fall Star Party".

For 10/25/19:
Friday, Oct 25, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Blue planets in opposition"

The ONU Astronomy Club wants you to join them on a celebration of blue planets and Halloween! Feel free to wear your costume to this astro-event. Free glow-stick products for kids while supplies last. Halloween is related to astronomy much like the solstices and equinoxes. It evolved out of a pagan celebration of the "cross-quarter" day mid-way between the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice. In modern times, the true cross-quarter day is around November 7, but before the Gregorian calendar was adopted, it fell near Oct 31. Now for the oppositions. The blue-green planet Uranus will reach opposition on Oct 28 shortly after its closest approach to Earth on Oct 27. Meanwhile, blue Neptune passed opposition on Sept. 9. This means that both planets are near their optimum observability; they are up all night and are as close to the Earth as they get. During tonight's star party, we will glimpse these distant planets and perhaps a few of their moons.


This event will be cancelled in the event of bad weather.

For 11/11/19:
Monday, Nov 11, 10:00am -12:00 pm. -- Daytime Public Event: 
                  "The transit of Mercury across the Sun"

ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU
Observatory any time between 10:00 am and noon on Monday, November 11.
We will be witnessing a rare celestial event: the transit of 
Mercury across the Sun.  The planet Mercury will appear as a 
tiny, circular silhouette on the face of the Sun as it 
undergoes an almost perfect syzygy (3-body alignment) with the Sun and Earth.  
(Warning: don't try to view this without proper filters!)
The center of the event occurs at 10:20 am (EST), and its beginning 
and ending are 7:35 am and 1:04 pm EST, respectively.
Mercury transits are not as rare as Venus transits, with 13 or 14
per century, but many of them occur when the Sun is set.  
The next transit of Mercury is in November of 2032, but the 
next one visible from Ohio will be in May, 2049.
Also, Mercury's minimum separation from the Sun will be only 75.9
arcseconds, the closest of the 21st century.  The next time it
will pass closer than 75" will be on Nov 12, 2190.  
We will have several ways of viewing the Sun safely during this event. 
If it is cloudy (as forecasted), we will still be open to view
live streaming from other observatories.

% Mercury is ~10" across during Nov transits, ~12" for May transits.
% Time between consecutive transits can be 3.5, 7, 9.5, 10, or 13 yrs.

For 2/14/20:
Friday, Feb 14, 7:00-9:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Venus, Goddess of Love"

ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by
the ONU Observatory between 7:00-9:00 pm this Valentine's
Day to celebrate "Venus, Goddess of Love" and other Valentine's
themes.  The planet Venus will be the brightest object in the
Western sky.  It will be an easy target for the telescope, although
we cannot see through the veil of sulfuric acid clouds on
this "hottie" of a planet.  Continuing the Valentine's theme,
we can look for more challenging deep sky objects like the
Heart Nebula and the Heart-shaped Cluster (Messier 50).
It turns out that dozens of heart shaped features have been
discovered on other planets, like Mars, although they are not quite 
visible from ground-based telescopes.

Maps to the ONU Observatory can be found here:
https://www2.onu.edu/~j-pinkney/astro/ONUObservatory.html

The forecast is currently calling for partly cloudy and cold (20 F) 
weather.  We will announce any cancellations by Friday at 2:30.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For 2/28/20:
Friday, Feb 28, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Leap Days and Time"

ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by
the ONU Observatory between 8:00-10:00 pm this Friday night.
Dr. Pinkney plans to give a short presentation about "Leap Days
and Time" at 9 pm.  This year, 2020, is a leap year which means that the
calendar will include a "Feb 29" for the first time in 4 years.
Why do we do this and how long have we been doing it?  
Our telescopic targets will include Venus and the Moon, which will be 
separated by only 14 degrees.  Uranus is midway between them.
The winter Milky Way with its many interesting deep sky objects will
also be well placed in the sky.

The forecast is currently calling for partly cloudy and cold (20 F) 
weather.  We will announce any cancellations by Friday at 2:30.

For 9/16/22:
Friday, Sept 16, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Neptune at its closest"

ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory 
between 9:00-11:00 pm this Friday, September 16 for the first astronomy public 
event of the Fall season.   Each event is planned around some theme or a celestial
happening.  This Friday, September 16, is the date that Neptune will be
at its closest to the Earth.  That is, Neptune will be in opposition.  
This is also when a planet looks its biggest and brightest in a telescope.  
Neptune is too faint to see with the unaided  eye, but it appears as a blue
dot through our telescopes.  Saturn, will also be well placed for viewing  
because it recently passed opposition on August 14.   It is easier to 
see features of Saturn, like its moons and its amazing rings!
Come and see these and other wonders of the night sky!


The forecast (as of 9/13) is calling for partly cloudy and warm (68 F)
weather.  We will announce any cancellations by Friday, 2:30 pm, here:
https://jpastro.net/astro/publicevents.html

For 9/23/22:
Friday, Sept 23, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Autumnal Equinox and Jupiter at its best"

ONU and the surrounding community are invited to drop by the ONU Observatory 
between 8:00-10:00 pm this Friday, September 23 for the second astronomy public 
event of the Fall season.   This Friday is a celebration of the autumnal equinox
or the start of autumn.  This year, the actual moment when the Sun crosses the 
celestial equator on its way south is on September 22
(around 9 pm EST).   After this date, the length of nighttime will surpass the length
of daytime (which is good for skygazing!).  
Saturn will make an excellent target for our telescopes.  Jupiter rises a 
little later but is even brighter than Saturn.  In fact, it will be at its
brightest on September 26 when it is closest to the Earth (opposition).


The forecast (as of 9/20) is calling for mostly cloudy (90% overcast) 
and cool (53 F) weather.  This probably means we will cancel.  We will 
post a cancellation notice by Friday, 2:30 pm, here:
https://jpastro.net/astro/publicevents.html

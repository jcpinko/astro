The ONU Observatory has been holding public events since Fall of 2010.
These records are currently incomplete and somewhat irregular.  
(We're working on it.)  Also, about half of these events were
cancelled because of bad weather (the cancellation record
tends to be worse in the spring than the fall).

Friday, Jan 27, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"The ISS flies by Mars and Venus"
<!--  <div class="mynote">
The ONU Observatory will be open to the public from
8 - 10 pm on Friday, January 27, 2017 for our first event
of the Spring semester.  It is entitled "The ISS flies
by Mars and Venus".  Around 8:24 pm, EST, the ISS
(International Space Station) will rise in the southwest
and pass by Venus and Mars as seen from Ada, OH.  The
brightness of the ISS will only be rivaled by Venus.
After that passage, we will observe Mars and Venus as well
as deep sky objects using our many telescopes.

Friday, Feb 17, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.
"Brilliant Venus"
<br>
<!-- 
<div class="mynote">
The ONU Observatory will be open to the public from
8 - 10 pm on Friday, February 17, 2017 for our
"Brilliant Venus" event.
Have you noticed Venus getting brighter in the western
sky after sunset?  It reaches its "maximum brilliancy" on
Feb 16, and we will be celebrating this on our Friday
public event.  Venus will greatly outshine nearby Mars and
Uranus.  Through the telescope, you will discern it's crescent
phase.  Maximum brilliancy is the moment when the illuminated
part of Venus presents to us the largest solid angle (an angular area).
This actually occurs a little while after the date of maximum
brightness, and before Venus is closest to the Earth.
At any rate, Venus is cool ... or rather, hot!  At 860 degrees
F, it is hot enough to melt lead and its clouds contain
sulfuric acid.  In addition to viewing Venus, Mars and Uranus,
we can observe deep sky objects like the Great Orion Nebula
without interference by moonlight.
</div>
-->
<!--
Venus reaches "Greatest Brilliancy" on Feb 16, but it will be just
about as big and bright on this day.  Plus, Venus, Mars and Uranus
are 2 days away (2/19) from conjunction.
New padded chairs!

<br>
Friday, Mar 3, 8:00-10:00 pm. -- Public Event.&nbsp; "Craters and Maria of the Moon"
<!--
<div class="mynote">
The ONU Astronomy Club welcomes you to the ONU
Observatory on Friday, March 3, 2017 for our
"Craters and Maria of the Moon" event.  Stop by
any time between 8 and 10 pm to look through our
telescopes or ask questions about the night sky.
On this night, the crescent Moon will be high in the
southwest, well placed for viewing.  The phase is
a good one for seeing interesting lunar features
such as the Posidonius Crater with its fissures, and
Mare Tranquillitatus, where Apollo 11 landed.
Other targets will include Venus, Mars and deep
sky objects.
</div>

<br>
<!--
<div class="itson">

<!--
The Moon was New on Feb 26, so it is 5 days old.
Sunset 7:23 pm.  8pm still has twilight but Moon is well placed.
Venus has alt=22 deg at 8pm. Mars has alt=32 deg.
        Feb 3 would also work with the Moon at 48% illum. Venus
and Mars are closer together on Feb 3.
Note: on the next day, Mar 4, the Moon occults Aldebaran.

<br>
Friday, Mar 17, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Star Formation in Orion"
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
Ada and the surrounding communities are invited to the
ONU Observatory on Friday, March 17 from 9-11 pm for
"Star Formation in Orion".  It may seem like the stars are
eternal, but they do eventually die out.  They are also
born hundreds at a time out of giant clouds of gas and dust.
One of the most frequently studied
and nearby "stellar nurseries" is in the constellation Orion.
It is called the "Orion Nebula" and it is one of the easiest
nebulosities to see with a telescope.
The Orion Nebula will be well-placed in the sky for observing
during our event.  There will also be a short presentation
about star formation showing beautiful images of the Orion
Nebula and other sites of star formation.
</div>

<!--
<div class="cancel">

<!--
DST started on Mar 11 so definitely need to start at 9pm EDT (there's
still some twilight).
Orion transits at 8:20 pm, just before sunset, but it is still high
enough to observe as it heads west from 9-11 pm.
-->
<br>
Friday, Mar 31, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event.&nbsp; "Glimpse Mercury"-> "Comet Pours from Big Dipper"
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
The ONU Observatory will be open to the public from 9 - 11 pm
on Friday, March 31.  This event was originally meant to
highlight Mercury, which is near its greatest eastern
elongation away from the Sun.  However, a periodic comet
called 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak has come to steal the show.
It is just a little under the naked eye limit but easily
seen in a telescope.  At its closest on Apr 1 (no fooling),
the comet will be unusually close to the Earth: 14% of the
Earth-Sun distance. It will be positioned
in the constellation Ursa Major and flying out of
the cup of the Big Dipper asterism.
Also available for viewing will be the crescent Moon
and the Great Orion Nebula.
</div>
-->
<br>
<!--
<div class="cancel">
This event is cancelled because of clouds and rain.
</div>
-->
<!--
Mercury is at Greatest East.Elong. on 4/1/17.  Its elongation at GEE
will be about 19 degrees and it is a good appearance in that the
line from the Sun to Mercury is almost perpendicular to the horizon.
The Moon will be a crescent (20%) in the West and Jupiter will rise
later in the Night.  Hydra near the meridian.
The biggest elongation angle between 2010-2020 is 27.8 deg and
the smallest is 17.9.
-->
Friday, Apr 7, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event. "Jupiter at opposition"
<br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
The ONU Astronomy Club hosts a free astronomy event on Friday,
April 7 from 9-11 pm.  The main attraction will be Jupiter which
reaches opposition on this day.  Opposition is when superior
planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc), are seen in the opposite
direction as the Sun from the Earth's perspective. That is, the
Earth is located directly in-between the Sun and that planet.
This is a great time to look at the planet
since it is as close to us as it gets.  Jupiter will rise around
9 pm in the constellation Virgo and reach an altitude of 10 degrees
by 9:40 pm, EDT. A nearly-full Moon will be nearby in the
constellation Leo.  Weather permitting, it should be a good night to enjoy some
of the brighter celestial objects!

Friday, Apr 21, 9:00-11:00 pm. -- Public Event.&nbsp; "Galaxies of Spring"

<!-- Moon 5 days until New.  N3115 in Hydra. This night is also
2 days before the Lyrid meteor shower peak. --><br>
<!--
<div class="mynote">
Ada and the surrounding communities are invited to the
ONU Observatory on Friday, April 21 from 9-11 pm
for "The Galaxies of Spring".  Galaxies are a swirling collection
of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter.  They are generally
difficult to see with telescopes because they are
so far away and faint.  During this time of the year, however,
the closest concentrations of galaxies are positioned
high in the sky by midnight.  We will be targeting such
galaxies as M66 in Leo and the "Black eye galaxy" in
Coma Berenices for observation with the telescopes.
By sheer luck, at 9:47 pm, an Iridium satellite is scheduled to flare
brightly just as it passes into Coma Berenices; a dot as bright
as Venus will momentarily mark our Milky Way's North Galactic
Pole!   So come and witness the wonders of the deep sky
as you learn about extragalactic astronomy!

	theme is the Orionid Meteor Shower.
	This annual shower produces a maximum of about
	25 "falling stars" per hour under optimum conditions.
	Our conditions will not be optimal because the constellation
	Orion (from which the meteors emanate) will
	not rise until around 11 pm.  However, the
	Moon will also not rise until late (after midnight)
	so that will keep the skies dark and make
	the meteors more obvious.
	
	Also available for viewing will be the planets
	Uranus, Neptune, Mars, and Venus, and deep sky objects
	like the ring nebula and the Andromeda Galaxy.

<!-- 
	<br>
	<div class="mynote">
	The ONU Astronomy Club will host a free event for the
	public at the ONU Observatory on Friday, Nov 4, from 8-10 pm.
	The theme is "The Blue Planets: Uranus and Neptune".
	These outermost two Jovian planets
	both have bluish hues attributed to methane in
	their atmospheres.  Each planet has an interesting history
	and unique characteristics.  Uranus is tilted about 98
	degrees onto its side so it has the most extreme seasons.
	It's moons (some of which can be spotted with our
	telescopes) are named after characters in works of
	Shakespeare and Pope.  The biggest Moon of Neptune, Triton, orbits
	retrograde to the planet's spin and is expected to one day merge with
	Neptune.  Neptune is also now the furthest
	planet from the Sun in our solar system, since Pluto was
	demoted.  But probably not for long. Astronomers are closing
	in on a "Planet IX" lurking somewhere in the Kuiper Belt.
	<br>
	
	At the beginning of the event, the crescent Moon
	will be just high enough to observe with telescopes.
	Also available for viewing will be the planet
	Mars and deep sky objects. So come and learn
	about astronomy at the ONU Observatory!

-- Public Event.&nbsp; "What We Learned From New Horizons" <br>
<!-- 
	<br>
	<div class="mynote">
	What better way to spend a "Black Friday" night than at
	the ONU Observatory looking at stars and planets?
	On November 25, 8-10 pm, the ONU Astronomy Club hosts
	its last event of the fall, "What we learned from
	New Horizons".  Since most of the students will be
	gone for break, we especially encourage the families of
	Ada and it's surrounding communities to come by with their
	questions about astronomy.
	
	The title refers to the New Horizons spacecraft that
	flew past the dwarf planet Pluto on July 14, 2015.  Since
	the flyby, it has been slowly trasmitting data back to
	Earth, and the last bits didn't arrive until Oct 25, 2016.
	Although Pluto is too faint to see through our telescopes,
	there will be a presentation around 9pm about this interesting
	object.  Of course, other objects will be accessible to our
	telescopes, including the most distant planet, Neptune.
	<br>
	As always, this event is contingent upon (mostly) clear weather.
	A cancellation will appear on the Public Events web page
	by 2 pm Friday if cloudy weather is likely.

Friday, October 12, 8:00 - 10:00 pm. --- "Experience ONU Day" Public
Event

<br>
<small> &gt;&gt;If the skies are clear, we plan to track down a new
Comet,
Uranus, and deep sky objects like the Ring Nebula
and the Andromeda Galaxy in our telescopes.
Weather forecast (as of Fri afternoon) is for clear skies and 40-45
degrees F.
</small><br>
<br>
Friday, November 2, 8:00 - 10:00 pm. --- "Comet Hergenrother flies
through Pegasus" Public Event
<span style="color: rgb(255, 100, 0);"> --Done. </span>
<br>

<small> &gt;&gt;
Tonight's featured target will be Comet 168/P Hergenrother which
is well-placed for observing in the constellation
of Pegasus. This comet has been brighter than expected
and is sporting a short tail. We will also observe various
deep sky objects, such as the Saturn Nebula and the Andromeda
Galaxy. Later in the evening, the planet Jupiter will rise
in the east, followed closely by the Moon.
</small><br>
<br>

Saturday, November 17, 8:00 - 10:00 pm. --- "Leonid Meteor Shower"
Public Event
<span style="color: rgb(255, 100, 0);"> --Done. </span>
<br>

<small>
Tonight's event is chosen to coincide with the
peak of the Leonid Meteor Shower. This annual shower has
periodically produced "storms" of meteor activity, but
tonight it is only expected to produce 10-15 meteors/hour
for a given viewer. Meteors are also called "shooting stars".
They are the sand-grain-sized debris of comets that enter
the Earth's atmosphere so quickly that they create a bright
streak of light. The Leonid meteors originated in the
Comet Temple-Tuttle.
We will also observe various deep sky objects, the crescent
moon, and planets like Uranus and Jupiter.
</small>
<br>
<br>

Friday, December 7, 8:00 - 10:00 pm. --- "Jupiter at its Brightest"
Public Event
<span style="color: rgb(255, 100, 0);"> --Done. </span>
<br>
<small>
Jupiter recently passed through opposition on December 2. Opposition is
the configuration in which a planet appears from Earth to be in the
opposite direction as the Sun.
This is also the time in which the planet looks the brightest to us
because of its full
phase and its proximity to the Earth. During tonight's event, Jupiter
is still
nearly optimal in appearance, and so we will keep it in at least one
telescope all
night. In two hours, the planet rotates 1/5 of a full revolution and we
will watch
for moving features like the Great Red Spot and shadows cast by its
moons.
The view to the unaided eye is also spectacular since Jupiter will be
embedded in bright winter asterisms like the Pleiades and Orion, and
less than 5 degrees from the orange star Aldebaran. We plan to keep a
live Jupiter
video feed on our wall TV for easy viewing.
Other targets tonight may be the Great Orion Nebula, the Pleiades, and
Uranus.
If you've already seen these, feel free to request something new!

The actual peak in shower activity should occur
on the night of Aug 12-13 this year, but the meteors (or "shooting
stars") are visible over 5 days before and after this peak . The Moon
will not be up to interfere with the viewing. <br>

Perseid meteoroids are fragments of the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle which
are usually smaller than a pea. The meteors radiate away from the
constellation Perseus, sometimes exhibiting colors and glowing trains. <br>
      <br>
One does not need a telescope to view the Perseids, but our roll-off
roof observatory serves as a nice setting to view them. Also, the
telescopes will be in operation so you can take a break from meteors to
view planets or deep sky objects. You are encouraged to bring a
lawnchair to set up on the fields next to the observatory. See you
there! <br>

Venus played an important role in the history
of astronomy. The distance to Venus can be found using
trigonometric parallax if two observers on Earth can record
the ingress and egress times from widely separated locations.
With the distance to Venus known, one can calculate the average
distance between the Earth and the Sun (the Astronomical Unit,
92,955,807 miles), which is essential for finding the distance
to everything else in the universe. The first voyage of James Cook was
a mission to observe the 1761 transit of Venus from Tahiti. Subsequent
expeditions to observe transits of 1769, 1874 and 1882 allowed more
precise timings as astronomers learned how to deal with an optical
phenomenon called the ``black drop effect". </font><small><br>

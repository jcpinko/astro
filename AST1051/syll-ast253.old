Today</a>, 5th Edition.&nbsp; By Chaisson and McMillan.
</p>
<p><b>Course Description:</b>
<br>
This course is an introduction to astronomy. Astronomy has so many
subfields that it is impossible to cover them all in one quarter.
Hence,
this course deals with the solar system and leaves out a great deal of
material on the stars, galaxies and cosmology. We discuss not only
planets, but the myriad moons of those planets, comets, asteroids,
and the Sun in our solar system. We now have data on extrasolar planets
(planets around other stars) which challenge our theories of
solar system evolution.
<br>
A major theme of this quarter is learning by comparison.
The term "comparitive planetology" is often used to describe how
we can verify our hypotheses about the Earth by comparing it to the
other planets (especially Venus and Mars). Similarly, we are now
refining our overall view of the formation of our solar system
by comparing to extrasolar systems.
<br>
I plan on taking you out to use telescopes and look at the sky.
Mars is still well placed during winter quarter, as is Saturn, and
Jupiter should be observable later in the quarter. Try to ``keep an
eye on the sky" during this course and bring your questions to class.

<p>I will not to grade any "harder" than the above. However, if the
class
mean drops below 75, I will grade more leniently.
</p>
<p><b><font size="+0">Course Policies</font></b>
</p>
<p><i>Attendance </i>is important for doing well in this course.&nbsp;
Absenteeism can directly lower your grade if you miss a quiz or a
homework discussion.
<br>
&nbsp; Let me know in advance (e-mail is good) if you plan
to miss for a <b><i>valid reason</i></b> (e.g. your team is on the
road,
you are sick, you have a family emergency).&nbsp; <u>If you miss a
quiz
or exam because of an emergency, let me know as soon as possible, and
provide
proof of the emergency.</u>
</p>
<p><i>Homework</i> will consist mainly of reading and preparing to
discuss review questions from the textbook. You may also try your hand
at
working problems from the textbook. Math ability (or lack thereof)
will not have a great influence on graded material, but you should try
to improve your problem solving skills during this course. &nbsp;
Homework will not be accepted after it
has been graded. If you foresee yourself missing a deadline because of
an excusable absence, again, let me know ahead of time. Written
assignments will be scored to varying degrees on completeness and
correctness, but not every problem will be corrected.
I encourage you to discuss homework with your classmates.
</p>
<p><i>Quizzes </i>will be given on non-exam weeks.&nbsp; They will
consist
of about 10 multiple choice/short answer questions.&nbsp; They cover
the
assigned reading and especially the material discussed in class.&nbsp;
You can only make up a quiz that was missed because of a valid conflict
or emergency.&nbsp; Also, you can only make up the quiz before the
answers
are revealed (usually the next period). For this reason, I will drop
your
lowest quiz score.
</p>
<p><i>Exams </i>will be given roughly every 3 weeks. These will weigh
most
heavily towards your class grade. The final exam will be comprehensive,
but will emphasize the last 2-3 weeks of material.
</p>
<p><i>Disruptions. </i>You can ask questions during class and even
laugh
like a donkey when I tell a joke, but don't interfere with the learning
of the students around you.&nbsp; Class begins at 10:00 AM.&nbsp; Don't
be late or you may face public humiliation. You might also miss a
quiz.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In general, do not disrupt the class or you may be asked to leave.
</p>
<p><i>Cheating</i> will not be tolerated. During tests, do not use
outside
references like laptops, calculators, or notes UNLESS I explicitly
allow
them. Do not look at another person's quiz or exam while you are taking
one. Also, if you suspect someone is copying your answers, try to
prevent
it by moving or shielding your answers. The penalty for cheating is a
zero
score for the quiz or exam.
</p>
<p><i>Calculators</i>. I encourage you to use a calculator in this
class.
A simple calculator will suffice.
</p>
<p><i>Tutoring</i> is available. You are welcome to drop by during my
office
hours, or you can try to make an appointment. I will look for a
previous
astronomy student to provide tutoring. Stay tuned.&nbsp; You can also
try
the tutors provided by A&amp;S, although they may not have astronomy
experience,
they can probably do any math problem in this class. Science tutoring
sessions usually occur on Thursday evenings, starting at 7:00 PM.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>Lab (astro minors only):</b>
<br>
The lab for this class is Physics 255. Please sign up for this lab
during the first week if you are an astronomy minor. Otherwise, you
do not need the lab. Tentative meeting time is
Wednesday, 10:00-noon. We will meet on the second week of class.<br>

<b>Course Description:</b>

<p>
Astronomy has so many subfields that it is impossible to cover 
them all in one semester.  This course deals mainly with the solar 
system (hence "Planetary Astronomy").  Stars, galaxies and
cosmology are covered in PHYS 1061.  We begin historically
with man's interpretation of the nighttime sky; the "naked eye universe"
is that which we can see without a telescope. &nbsp; We then look
in detail at the Sun and planets.  Two natural categories
of planets emerge: the terrestrials and the Jovians.  
We are now in a golden age of discovery with space missions 
like the Parker Solar Probe,  James Webb Space Telescope, InSight, 
and Perseverance in the news this year.
Finally the comets, asteroids and Kuiper Belt Objects
are small but important for understanding the early formation
of the solar system.  We now have data on over 5000 extrasolar planets
(planets around other stars) which challenge our theories of
solar system formation and evolution.&nbsp;
</p>

<!-- Old Objectives
<p>
I have many goals for you in Planetary Astronomy.  I want
you to see how learning facts about planets (their weather
systems, surface features, etc.) allows us to better
generalize about planetary processes, and thus improve
our understanding of our own Earth. 
This is called "comparative planetology". 
Math has played a big role in the development of astronomy (and vice versa),
so I would like to challenge you with occasional activities and homeworks requiring
math.  However, you can still do well on the quizzes and exams without
great math skills.  I will make sure that you get a chance to study the sky
directly, using the unaided eye and telescopes, at the 
<a href="https://jpastro.net/astro/ONUObservatory.html"> 
ONU Observatory</a>.  
&nbsp; Try to ``keep an eye on the sky" during this course.  Please
bring your astronomical questions and news items to class for brief discussions.
A final goal is for you to see science as valuable and distinct from
pseudo-sciences (like astrology) which are rejected by
the scientific method.  </p>

-->

<b>Course Objectives: </b> <br>
By the end of this course, students will:
<ul>
<li> Obtain knowledge of astronomy, including the planets, comets and asteroids
<!-- to include
history - the heliocentric revolution
The Sun and stars
stellar properties (report on your assigned star) 
Galaxies 
-->
<li> Recognize some of the laws of physics inherent in astronomy
<!-- such as
conservation of mass-energy (nuclear fusion in stars)
conservation of angular momentum formation of stars and galaxies 
universal gravitation in orbits of planets, stars and galaxies
-->
<li> Develop scientific skills related to astronomy
<!-- such as
critical thinking (asking "how do you know that?"), 
problem solving (homework problems)
visual observing and object identification (observing forms)
pattern recognition (constellation sheets).
-->
<li> Expand their personal cosmology ("theory of everything")
<!-- quantify the relative sizes of ...
the Earth, solar system, Milky Way Galaxy, superclusters
of galaxies, and the cosmic microwave background.
-->
<li> Understand the nature of science in general
<!--  how it differs from pseudoscience and other belief systems
how it uses the scientific method, 
how it relies on math and statistics.
-->
</ul>

<!-- One assignment
PHYS 1051 fulfills the general education learning 
outcome #4: 'knowledge of the physical and natural world'.  
-->

<b>Pre-requisites:&nbsp; </b> None.

<b>Text:</b>
<a  href="
http://www.mypearsonstore.com/bookstore/astronomy-today-9780134450278"
>Astronomy Today, 9/E </a> &nbsp; (9th Edition)&nbsp; by Chaisson and McMillan.
This 2017 edition has a "rent-only" ISBN-13 of 978-0134450278. This is what we 
have in the bookstore.  Do NOT buy the Volume 1 or 2 versions 
("The Solar System" and "Stars and Galaxies"). I don't require you to bring the text to class.
<br>
<br>

<b>Lab:</b>
The lab for this class, PHYS 1081 (1 hr), is mainly intended for 
astronomy minors and physics majors with astronomy concentration.  
It will not be run this fall.
<!--
I may make exceptions for interested students.  Contact me for an override.
If you are registered for the lab, expect an email during the first week for
scheduling our meeting times.
-->
<br>
<br>

<!--
<b>The Astronomy Minor:</b>
You might consider being an <a href="https://www.onu.edu/academics/astronomy">
astronomy minor </a> if a good familiarity with astronomy 
would complement your current major. Consider entering an exciting field like 
astrobiology, astrochemistry, archeoastronomy, cosmochemistry, science education, 
science illustration, or science journalism.
<br>
<br>
-->

<b>Observatory:</b>
Your visits to the <a href="https://jpastro.net/astro/ONUObservatory.html">
ONU Observatory</a> will weigh into the "Observing" portion of your grade (see 
below). 
You should try to visit at least 3 times for full credit.  
There is a legal pad in the control room that you must sign for credit. 
You can visit for as little as 10 minutes for credit, but to make progress
on your <b>observing forms</b> and <b>constellation sheets</b>, you should
plan to stay at least 30 minutes.  Bring your pre-labelled sheets along with you.
The best times to visit are on Friday nights when the weather calls for
&lt 50% cloudcover.  The exact times will be announced in class.  
I'm planning 5 of the Fridays to be 
<a href="https://jpastro.net/astro/publicevents.html">Public Events </a>
in which the surrounding community is invited.  These last for 2 hours.  
The other Friday observing sessions will last for only 1 hour.
Another time to visit is during meetings of the ONU Astronomy Club every 
other Wednesday night at 9 pm.
<!--
The times I am most 
likely to be there are: 1) during Friday evenings for 
<a href="https://jpastro.net/astro/publicevents.html">Public Events</a> (every 2-3 weeks), 2) during Wednesday evenings around 
9:30-10:30 pm for ONU Astronomy Club (every other Wednesday) and 
3) during astronomy lab nights (TBD). 
-->
You can bring a friend (not necessarily enrolled in the class) for the 
long, dark walk to the Observatory. 
While there, follow these rules: 1) don't shine lights in other people's eyes,
2) keep lines spread out, and 3) don't push on the telescopes or touch their 
optics.  Again, bring along the <b>observing forms</b> and 
<b>constellation sheets</b> that were given to you in class, and
label the <b>constellation sheets</b> ahead of time.

<span >I will not grade
any "harder" than the above. However, if the
class mean drops below about 75, I usually grade more leniently.
<br>
<br >
</span><b ><font size="-0">Other Course Policies</font></b><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
</span><br>
<br>

<i><b>Canvas </b></i>
will only be used sparingly for this class unless we have to go online.  
I will make files like homework keys or Powerpoints available on this web page. I plan to import my grades into the Canvas gradebook but it may be delayed a 
little. Canvas is here:
<a href="https://onu.instructure.com">here</a>.
<br><br>

<i><b>Attendance </b> </i> <span style="font-size: 0.9em"> is
important for doing well in this course.&nbsp;
Absence can directly lower your grade if you miss a quiz or
in-class activity.&nbsp; Also, I record attendance on many days and
then form a score out of your attendance which factors into
the "In-class" part of your grade.
Let me know in advance (e-mail is good) if you plan
to miss for a <b ><i>valid reason</i></b>
(e.g. your team is on the
road, you are sick, you have a family emergency).&nbsp; 
<u> If you miss a quiz or exam because of an emergency, let me know 
as soon as possible, and provide proof of the emergency.</u>
"Proof" may consist of the
name and phone number of some parent or authority figure who knows your
situation. If you miss an in-class worksheet
activity, you should get a copy of the worksheet but you won't
receive credit for that work.
</span><br><br>

<i><b> Homework </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
will consist mainly of
reading the textbook and writing answers to review questions
from the textbook. Some math problems will also be assigned
from the textbook.  &nbsp;
Homework will receive 50% credit if turned in late. It will be scored
on completeness and correctness, but not every problem will be checked.
You can discuss homework with your classmates, but don't copy
their work verbatim. After a warning, you'll be docked points.
Look for keys posted after the homework is due. 
</span><br><br>

<i><b> Turning in Assignments. </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
<!-- I have shared a <a href=""> Google Drive folder </a> with you 
to use for turning in assignments. 
You should create a subfolder with a name like: Lastname_Firstname.  
Some might involve drawings which should be scanned and then
turned into a PDF file.  The assignment will be annotated to indicate how 
your grade was determined.
-->
This semester I will be accepting only hardcopies of homework (as opposed
to scanning and uploading).  
These can be written out by hand if you can write neatly, but printouts of Word
documents are preferred.  Do not email the assignments to me without
special permission.
</span><br><br>

<i><b> Quizzes </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
will be given on some non-exam weeks.&nbsp; They will consist
of about 10 multiple choice or short answer questions.&nbsp; They cover
the assigned reading and especially the material discussed in class.&nbsp;
You can only make up a quiz that was missed because of an excused conflict
or emergency.&nbsp; Also, you can only make up the quiz before the
answers are revealed (usually the next class). For this reason, I will
drop your lowest quiz score.  Expect a total of 6-7 quizzes.
</span><br><br>

<i><b> Exams </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
will be given roughly every 4-5 weeks. 
These will weigh most heavily towards your class
grade. The final exam will be comprehensive, but will emphasize the
last 2-3 weeks of material. 
</span> <br><br>

<i><b> Review Questions </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
will be provided to help you prepare for 
<i>Quizzes</i> and <i>Exams</i>. 
They will 
appear under "NEW STUFF" on this web page. Many of these questions will appear on the 
<i>Quizzes</i> and <i>Exams</i> and so it is strongly recommended that you use them to 
prepare. More than half of the questions on a given test will be found 
in the review.   
</span><br><br>

<i><b> Observing </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
consists of filling out <b> constellation sheets </b> and visiting the ONU 
Observatory.  The
"<a href="https://jpastro.net/AST1051/PROT1051/ConstSheetsFall.pdf"> 
constellation sheets </a> include 2 maps for 2 dates during the 
semester (4 sheets total). Your job is to 1) write the names of the 
constellations within the constellation boundaries, and 2) 
<!-- put a check only in the constellations that you actually spotted 
in the sky. -->
Fill out this <a href="./ObservingForm.pdf"> Observing Form  </a> on two 
different occasions in which you actually viewed the sky.  
#1 can be done on your laptop using the <i>Stellarium</i>  planetarium program. 
#2 must be done under open skies, but not necessarily at the ONU Observatory. Label all
of the constellations on the maps, and the 6 brightest stars on each map.
For full observing credit, you must visit the observatory at 
least 3 times. 
<!-- Additional visits give you extra credit in the "Observing" 
portion of your grade. -->
<u> Signing the log </u> at the observatory will get you the observing
credit. The Observing Forms and constellation sheets are due on the last
day of class. 

</span><br><br>

<i><b> Disruptions </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
You should ask questions during class, and talk during group activities, 
otherwise you shouldn't talk while the professor is talking. 
Anything that distracts your teacher or your neighbors is hindering 
the teaching/learning process. This includes playing with your phones, 
laptops or tablets, talking with neighbors, coming to class late, and 
leaving class early. 
If you want to use a laptop or tablet in class, you must show me how you 
can write equations and figures into your notes with it.   
</span><br><br>

<i><b> Academic Misconduct </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
In PHYS 1051 (this class), the biggest temptation will be to look at
another person's work during tests.  Spread out before tests.
Do not wear caps during tests. Do not use phones or electronic devices
to help you.  A calculator (not a phone calculator) is acceptable
if it isn't used to store information.
The penalty for cheating is a zero score for the quiz or exam. 
See the link to the university code of conduct in the table below.
</span><br><br>

<i><b> Calculators </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
I encourage you to use a calculator in this class. 
A simple calculator will suffice.
</span><br><br>

<i><b> Tutoring </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
is available. You are welcome to drop by during my office hours, 
or you can make an appointment for another time.  The physics
department usually has tutors on Thursday evenings (TBA) in Science
Annex 116. 
</span><br><br>

<i><b> ONU Health & Safety </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
ONU wrote this
<a href=" https://www.onu.edu/sites/default/files/onu-safetyplan-2021-22-6.pdf" >Safety Plan for 2021-2022 
</a> on 8/9/21.  The key point is that all students must wear masks in class.
During the delta surge, it is wise to wear a mask indoors even if vaccinated.
We are not requiring social distancing, but it is still a good idea to be
spread out in our seating.  Let me know if you have to quarantine or isolate
so that I can help you keep up with the class.

In accordance with the University’s COVID-19 safety plan and the 
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TxM5pA0mfdMvw-t5dYvaaUGYbarYZfvM/view" >
Polar Pledge </a>, all
students will wear face coverings at all times in academic buildings. Additionally, students
are to maintain a social distance of 6 feet when possible, especially when in conversation
with others, during academic course meetings, and while waiting for a classroom to open.
No eating or drinking will be allowed during course meetings. Students who violate this
policy will be asked to leave the building immediately and must comply with this request.
Additionally, students will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for adjudication.
Students who are unable to wear a face covering will need to make arrangements for
accommodations with the Student Disability Coordinator prior to or during the first week 
of classes. ( <a href="https://www.onu.edu/disability-services" >

<p><font size="+2"><b>Review and Discussion of Ch. 6: <i>The Solar
System&nbsp; </i><small>(answers only)</small><i> </i> </b></font>
</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>Types of objects in the solar system include: a star (the Sun),
solar wind (particles), gas planets, Earth-like planets, life forms,
moons, ring systems, asteroids, comets, and Kuiper Belt objects. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Comparative planetology is comparing and contrasting the
properties of the diverse worlds we encounter -to understand better the
formation and evolution of planets.&nbsp; It is useful in that it
provides numerous testing grounds for planetary formation hypotheses,
rather than having just one example to test ones hypotheses.&nbsp; Its
ultimate goal is to explain planetary evolution.&nbsp; For many
(geologists, meteorologists, ecologists) the goal is to better
understand the Earth.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li>One needs to know the distance to a planet if determining its
mass from the orbits of its moons.&nbsp; The orbital period and the
maximum angular separation of the moon away from the planet can be
measured directly, but finding the mass will require one to know the
average distance between the planet and its moon.&nbsp; This
planet-moon distance can be found if we know the Earth-planet
distance.&nbsp; Dp-m/De-p = angle.&nbsp; Then use Newton's form of
Kepler's 3rd law to solve for the total mass.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Ways the solar system is orderly: planets are revolve CCW as seen
from north, planets orbits fall nearly in the same plane, dense worlds
lie close to the Sun while less dense worlds lie far from the
Sun.&nbsp; <br>
  </li>
  <li>Ways the solar system is disorderly:&nbsp; the rotation axes of
planets point in many different directions, Pluto does not fit neatly
into the two main groups of planets.<br>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li>The Terrestrial planets are Earth, Mercury, Venus and Mars.&nbsp;
The prefix "terra" means "earth", so the name implies that they are
Earth-like planets.
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li>The Jovian planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
Neptune.&nbsp; The word origin is "Jove" which is the same Roman diety
after which Jupiter was named. Thus, these planets are Jupiter-like.</li>
  <li>Important differences between Jovians and terrestrials?
    <ul>
      <li>size/mass </li>
      <li>composition <br>
      </li>
      <li>distance from Sun </li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li>Pluto has a size, mass, and surface like the terrestrial planets,
but its distance from the sun and composition are Jovian.&nbsp; Thus it
is difficult to put Pluto in either category unless we decide that one
particular property is the determinant.<br>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Asteroids and meteoroids are important because they formed close
to the time of the solar systems formation.&nbsp; Meteoroids can be
fragments of asteroids, but most of them are small and originate in
comets.&nbsp; The asteroid fragments can reach Earth's surface where we
can analyze them.&nbsp; <br>
These objects are important for another reason: the pose a potential
hazard to all of life on Earth should a large one crash into the Earth.<br>
  </li>
  <li>We know of the composition of comets from ground-based
spectroscopy.&nbsp; This is most effective for learning the
constituents of the gas tails.&nbsp; The dust particles are more
difficult to discern with spectroscopy.&nbsp; Recently, however, actual
cometary material has been probed and gathered by satellites such as
"Stardust" and "Deep Impact". &nbsp;
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li>SKIP</li>
  <li>Scientists use gravity assists in order to save on fuel weight
and cost.&nbsp; They plan the trajectories of the spacecraft to pass
behind planets as they pass by. The planet pulls on the spacecraft,
speeding it up and giving it energy.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li>All of the planets have been visited by Earth except Pluto.&nbsp;
Some of the visits were just "fly-bys", while Venus, Mars, Jupiter
(arguably, because it has no solid surface) and some moons (the Moon,
Titan), have been landed upon.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li>Galileo and Cassini took circuitous routes in order to take
advantage of gravity assists by other planets.&nbsp; This saved on the
weight and cost of fuel. Voyager and Pioneer also took advantage of
gravity assists, but the computation of orbits was not as fast and
precise as it is today.

  </li>
  <li>The condensation theory explains the compositional differences of
the Terrestrials and Jovians.&nbsp; The terrestrials were in a hot part
of the nebula where only high-melting point materials (iron-based,
silicates) could condense.&nbsp; At larger distances, ices of water,
carbon dioxide, ammonia could also condense.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, the
composition of the Jovians has much less abundent iron-based minerals,
for example.&nbsp; Also, since the lower melting point ices are also
lower in density, the density of the Jovians should be lower.&nbsp; The
gaseous molecules are more abundant in the solar nebula. So this also
explains why the Jovian protoplanets would be larger than the
terrestrial ones.&nbsp; (The greater size and mass of Jovians also came
about because they were more capable of capturing gas from the
surrounding nebula.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> </p>
(See above)&nbsp; Factors contributing to large mass of Jovians: more
materials were able to condense at the lower temperatures, more massive
protoplanet led to stronger gravity and thus more material attracted,
the lower temperatures and large mass enable the Jovians to hold onto
their atmospheres (whereas the same gas would escape from the surface
of Mercury).<br>

<b>Course Description:</b>

<p>
Astronomy has so many subfields that it is impossible to cover 
them all in one semester.  This course deals mainly with the solar 
system (hence "Planetary Astronomy").  Stars, galaxies and
cosmology are covered in PHYS 1061.  We begin historically
with man's interpretation of the nighttime sky; the "naked eye universe"
is that which we can see without a telescope. &nbsp; We then look
in detail at the Sun and planets.  Space missions, like Juno, 
New Horizons, and Messenger, continue to make discoveries about 
planets and their myriad moons.
Finally the comets, asteroids and Kuiper Belt Objects
are small but important for understanding the early formation
of the solar system.  We now have data on over 1000 extrasolar planets
(planets around other stars) which challenge our theories of
solar system formation and evolution.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
I have many goals for you in Planetary Astronomy.  I want
you to appreciate the way that learning facts about a planet (its weather
systems, surface features, etc.) allows us to
generalize about planetary processes, and thus improve
our understanding of our own Earth. 
This is called "comparative planetology". 
Math has played a big role in the development of astronomy (and vice versa),
so I would like to challenge you with a few problems every
week.  However, your math skills (or lack thereof) will not
have much effect on your grade.
I will make sure that you get a chance to study the sky
directly, using the unaided eye and telescopes, at the 
<a href="http://www2.onu.edu/~j-pinkney/astro/ONUObservatory.html"> 
ONU Observatory</a>.  
&nbsp; Try to ``keep an eye on the sky" during this course and bring 
your questions and news items to class for discussion.
A final goal is for you to see science as distinct from
pseudo-sciences, like astrology, which are rejected by
the scientific method.  </p>
<p>
PHYS 1051 was <b> tagged </b>
to fulfill general education outcome #3:
'scientific and quantitative literacy'.  &nbsp; Under the new system, 
it fulfills the learning outcome #4: 'knowledge of the physical and 
natural world'.  
<!-- One assignment
will also be an 'artifact' showing how this outcome was met.&nbsp;
Students entering ONU on or after Fall 2011 should archive this
artifact with <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.onu.edu/files/student_guide_to_taskstream_0.pdf"> Taskstream </a> .
-->
</p>

<b>Pre-requisites:&nbsp; </b> None.

<a  href="http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/academic/product/0,3110,0132400855,00.html">Astronomy
Today, 8/E </a> &nbsp; (8th Edition)&nbsp; by Chaisson and McMillan.
This is a 2014 edition and so you should be able to rent it or find a used copy.
<br>
<br>

<b>Lab:</b>
The lab for this class, PHYS 1081 (1 hr), is only taken by astronomy minors.  
(You might consider being a minor if your major requires you to take a lot of 
physics.)  Minors should sign up for this lab and speak with me during
the first week to set up meeting times.  
<br>
<br>

<b>Observatory:</b>
Your visits to the <a href="http://www2.onu.edu/~j-pinkney/astro/ONUObservatory.html">
ONU Observatory</a> will weigh into the "Observing" portion of your grade (see 
below). There will be one class period which meets at the Observatory to 
observe the Sun. You should try to visit at least 3 additional times, 
for "A" work. There is a legal pad in the control room that you must sign 
for credit. Most of the nights are too cloudy to observe, and the 
time of sunset gets progressively earlier. This is why there is no fixed 
time to visit. Also, I do not open the Observatory every clear night. 
Your strategy must be to watch the weather and call the 
Observatory on clear nights to see if it is open. The times I am most 
likely to be there are: 1) during Friday evenings for 
<a href="https://www2.onu.edu/~j-pinkney/astro/publicevents.html">Public Events</a> (every 2-3 weeks), 2) during Wednesday evenings around 
9:30-10:30 pm for ONU Astronomy Club (every other Wednesday) and 
3) during astronomy lab nights (TBD). When you visit, 
bring along your <b> constellation sheets </b> (see below), and try to get some views 
through our telescopes and binoculars. I should be able to get you started 
on your constellations, even though my main focus may be on the event. You 
should bring a friend or two (not necessarily enrolled in the class) for 
the long, dark walk to the Observatory.

<span >I will not grade
any "harder" than the above. However, if the
class mean drops below about 75, I usually grade more leniently.
<br>
<br >
</span><b ><font size="-0">Other Course Policies</font></b><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
</span><br>
<br>

<i><b>Attendance </b> </i> <span style="font-size: 0.9em"> is
important for doing well in this course.&nbsp;
Absence can directly lower your grade if you miss a quiz or
in-class activity.&nbsp; Also, I record attendance on many days and
then form a score out of your attendance which factors into
the "In-class" part of your grade.
Let me know in advance (e-mail is good) if you plan
to miss for a <b ><i>valid reason</i></b>
(e.g. your team is on the
road, you are sick, you have a family emergency).&nbsp; 
<u> If you miss a quiz or exam because of an emergency, let me know 
as soon as possible, and provide proof of the emergency.</u>
"Proof" may consist of the
name and phone number of some parent or authority figure who knows your
situation. If you miss an in-class worksheet
activity, you should get a copy of the worksheet but you won't
receive credit for that work.
</span><br><br>

<i><b> Homework </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
will consist mainly of
reading the textbook and writing answers to review questions
from the textbook. Some math problems will also be assigned
from the textbook.  &nbsp;
Homework will receive 50% credit if turned in late. It will be scored
on completeness and correctness, but not every problem will be checked.
You should discuss homework with your classmates, but don't copy
their work verbatim. After a warning, you'll be docked points.
</span><br><br>

<i><b> Quizzes </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
will be
given on non-exam weeks.&nbsp; They will consist
of about 10 multiple choice/short answer questions.&nbsp; They cover
the
assigned reading and especially the material discussed in class.&nbsp;
You can only make up a quiz that was missed because of an excused conflict
or emergency.&nbsp; Also, you can only make up the quiz before the
answers are revealed (usually the next class). For this reason, I will
drop your lowest quiz score.
</span><br><br>

<i><b> Exams </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
will be given roughly every 4-5 weeks. 
These will weigh most heavily towards your class
grade. The final exam will be comprehensive, but will emphasize the
last 5-6 weeks of material. 
</span> <br><br>

<i><b> Review Questions </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
will be provided to help you prepare for 
<i>Quizzes</i> and <i>Exams</i>. 
They will 
appear under "NEW STUFF". Many of these questions will appear on the 
<i>Quizzes</i> and <i>Exams</i> and so it is strongly recommended that you use them to 
prepare. More than half of the questions on a given test will be found 
in the review. 
</span><br><br>

<i><b> Observing </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
consists of filling out <b> constellation sheets </b> and visiting the ONU 
Observatory. 
"<a href="https://www2.onu.edu/%7Ej-pinkney/AST1051/PROT1051/SkySHoriz9pmSept20.png"> 
SkyMaps </a> like this contain 2 maps for 2 dates during the 
spring (4 sheets total). Your job is to 1) write the names of the 
constellations within the constellation boundaries, and 2) put a check 
only in the constellations that you actually spotted in the sky. #1 can be 
done on your laptop using a planetarium program. #2 must be done under 
open skies, but not necessarily at the ONU Observatory. Try to label at 
least 40 unique constellations, and try to spot at least 10 constellations 
in the sky. For full observing credit, you must visit the observatory at 
least 3 times. Additional visits give you extra credit in the "Observing" 
portion of your grade. Visiting the Observatory and <u> signing the log will 
get you credit</u>.
</span><br><br>

<i><b> Disruptions </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
You should ask questions during class, and talk during group activities, 
otherwise you shouldn't talk while the professor is talking. 
Anything that distracts your teacher or your neighbors is hindering 
the teaching/learning process. This includes playing with your phones, 
laptops or tablets, talking with neighbors, coming to class late, and 
leaving class early. 
</span><br><br>

<i><b> Academic Misconduct </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
Here is the Code of
Academic Student Conduct from the College
of A&amp;S: 
<font  color="#222222"><font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2"><br>
</font></font>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font  color="#222222"><font style="font-size: 11pt;" size="2">The
University expects its students to conduct themselves in a dignified
and honorable manner as mature members of the academic community and
assumes that individually and collectively they will discourage acts
of academic dishonesty.&nbsp; The University also expects cooperation
among administrators, faculty, staff, and students in preventing acts
of academic dishonesty, in detecting such acts, reporting them, and
identifying those who commit them, and in providing appropriate
punishment for offenders. The University Code of Academic Student
Conduct is found in Appendix C of the Student Handbook:</font></font><br>

In PHYS 1051
(this class), the biggest temptation will be to look at
another person's work during tests.  Spread out before tests.
Do not wear caps during tests. Do not use phones or electronic devices
to help you.  A calculator (not a phone calculator) is acceptable
if it isn't used to store information.
The penalty for cheating is a zero score for the quiz or exam. 
You may not receive any warning before your first zero score.
</span><br><br>

<i><b> Calculators </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
I encourage you to use a calculator in this class. 
A simple calculator will suffice.
</span><br><br>

<i><b> Tutoring </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
is available. You are welcome to drop by during my office hours, 
or you can make an appointment for another time. I will look for a 
previous astronomy student to provide tutoring.&nbsp;&nbsp; The physics
department usually has tutors on Thursday evenings (TBA) in Science
Annex 116.

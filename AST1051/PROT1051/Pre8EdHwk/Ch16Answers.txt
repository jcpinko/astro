Chapter 16 The Sun

Review and Discussion

1.  The main regions of the Sun are shown in Fig 16.2.
    The core includes the from center out to 200,000 km,
    the radiation/radiative zone is the next shell out
    to 500,000 km, and the convective zone takes up 
    most of the remaining space out to 700,000 km.
    Above these interior zones are the atmosphere including
    the photosphere (300 km thick), the chromosphere (~1500 km
    thick, the transition zone (~8000 km thick), and
    the corona (extends out into the solar wind in some places).

2. The mass of the Sun is 2x10^30 kg, while the Earth is
   only 4x10^24 kg.  So the Sun is about 300,000 times
   more massive than the Earth.

3. The solar surface is 5800 K, and the core is about 15
   million K. 

4. Luminosity is the total amount of energy leaving the Sun
   in the form of EM radiation in all directions per second.
   It can be measured in units of Watts.  It is a measure of
   the true brightness of the Sun and other stars.  It is
   determined by measuring the amount of energy/second passing 
   through a detector on the top of the Earth's atmosphere, and
   then multiplying that the ratio of the surface area of
   a sphere with a radius of 1 AU to the area of the detector.

15. The solar cycle is 22 years long because each consecutive
   11 year sunspot cycle has a reversal in the polarity of the
   sunspot pairs.

16. Sunspots, flares and prominances all tend to happen in the
   same region and so their causes should be related to the 
   strong, kinked magnetic field lines that pierce the Sun's
   surface at the locations of sunspots.  Sunspots are caused
   by the inhibition of convection in regions of strong magnetic
   fields at (and just under) the Sun's surface.  Flares are
   short-lived outbursts whose cause is not well understood,
   but is related to magnetic "reconnection" events.  Prominances
   are less energetic and long-lived outbursts of particles
   that form arches above the Sun tracing out the magnetic field lines.

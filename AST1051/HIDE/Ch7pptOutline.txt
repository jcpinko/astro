7.1 Overall Structure of Planet Earth 
• 
Mantle 
• 
Two-part core 
• 
Thin crust 
• 
Hydrosphere 
(oceans) 
• 
Atmosphere 
• 
Magnetosphere 

7.2 Earth’s Atmosphere 
• 
The blue curve 
shows the 
temperature at 
each altitude 
• 
Troposphere is 
where convection 
takes place— 
responsible for 
weather 

7.2 Earth’s Atmosphere 
Convection depends on warming of 
ground by the Sun 



7.2 Earth’s Atmosphere 
Ionosphere is ionized by solar radiation and is 
good conductor 

Reflects radio waves in the AM range, but 
transparent to FM and TV 

Ozone layer is between ionosphere and 
mesosphere; absorbs ultraviolet radiation 


7.2 Earth’s Atmosphere 
Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) have been 
damaging the ozone layer, resulting in ozone 
hole 


See 
Animation 



7.2 Earth’s Atmosphere 
Surface heating: 

• 
Sunlight that is not reflected is 
absorbed by Earth’s surface, warming it 
• 
Surface re-radiates as infrared thermal 
radiation 
• 
Atmosphere absorbs some infrared, 
causing further heating 

7.2 Earth’s Atmosphere 
This is known as the 


greenhouse effect 



More Precisely 7-1: Why Is the Sky Blue? 


Scattering of light by air 
depends on the 
wavelength of the light 
—the wavelength of 
blue light is closer to 
the size of air 
molecules, so it is 
scattered most 
strongly. The amount of 
molecular scattering is 
proportional to the 
inverse fourth power of 
the wavelength. 



More Precisely 7-1: Why Is the Sky Blue? 


When the Sun is close 
to the horizon, light is 
scattered by dust in the 
air. The more dust, the 
more scattering; if there 
is enough, the blue light 
is greatly diminished, 
leaving a red glow in 
the sky. 



7.2 Earth’s Atmosphere 
Earth’s atmosphere has evolved: 

• 
Primary atmosphere contained hydrogen, 
helium; these escaped Earth’s gravity 
• 
Secondary atmosphere, from volcanic 
activity, mostly nitrogen and CO2 released 
• 
Life appeared, creating atmospheric 
oxygen. CO2 partly absorbed by oceans and 
rock. 


Discovery 7-1: The Greenhouse 
Effect and Global Warming 


Modern society has 
increased CO2 levels in 
the atmosphere. 

A corresponding 
increase in global 
average temperature 
has been seen as well. 

Dramatic melting. 

Can we turn around the 
trend? 



The Greenhouse Effect and Global 
Warming 


Some possible consequences of global 
warming: 

• 
Rise in sea level 
• 
More severe weather 
• 
Crop failures (as climate zones change) 
• 
Expansion of deserts 
• 
Spread of tropical diseases away from the 
tropics 

7.3 Earth’s Interior 
Currently accepted 
model: 



7.3 Earthquakes probe Earth's interior 
Seismic waves: 
Earthquakes produce both 
pressure and shear waves. 
Pressure waves are 
longitudinal and will travel 
through both liquids and 
solids. 
Shear waves are transverse 
and will not travel through 
liquid, as liquids do not 
resist shear forces. 
Wave speed depends on 
the density of the material. 



7.3 Earth’s Interior 
We can use the pattern of reflections during 
Earth 

earthquakes to deduce interior structure of 

7.3 Earth’s Interior 
The Core is the densest, containing the 
highest concentration of iron and nickel. It is 
metallic (mostly metal). 

The outer core is liquid; inner core is solid, 
due to pressure 

Mantle is much less dense than core, and 
more rocky than metallic. We learn of the 
mantles composition from the volcanic lava 
which originates at the greatest depths. 


Discovery 7-2 
Earth’s “Rapidly” Spinning Core 


Analysis of seismic 
waves shows inner 
core rotating slightly 
faster than rest of 
Earth—about 1° faster 
per year. 



7.3 Earth’s Interior 
Earth was probably 
molten when formed 
and remelted due to 
bombardment by space 
debris. 

Differentiation occurred 
-heavier materials sank 
to the center. 

Radioactivity provides 
a continuing source of 
heat. 



7.4 Surface Activity 
At plate boundaries, get earthquakes and 
volcanoes 



7.4 Surface Activity 
Continental drift: Entire Earth’s surface is 
covered with crustal plates, which can move 
independently 



7.4 Surface Activity 
This is a subduction zone, where one plate 
slides below another 



7.4 Surface Activity 
A plate colliding with another can also raise 
it, resulting in very high mountains 



7.4 Surface Activity 
Plates can also slide 
along each other, 
creating faults where 
many earthquakes 
occur 



7.4 Surface Activity 
Finally, plates can move away from each other, 
creating rifts 



7.4 Surface Activity & Magnetic fields 
The new crust created at rift 
zones preserves the 
magnetic field present at the 
time it solidified. From this, 
we can tell that field 
reversals occur about every 
500,000 years. 



More Precisely 7-2: 
Radioactive Dating 


The number of protons in an atom’s 
nucleus determines which element it is. 
However, there may be different isotopes 
of the same element, with the same 
number of protons but different numbers 
of neutrons. Many of these isotopes are 
unstable and undergo radioactive decay. 
This decay is characterized by a half-life T: 

Fraction of material remaining = (1/2)t/T 



More Precisely 7-2: 
Radioactive Dating 


This plot shows the fraction of the original 
sample remaining as a function of time 



More Precisely 7-2: 
Radioactive Dating 


Half-lives have been measured in the 
laboratory for almost all known isotopes. 
Knowing these, we can use them for 
determining the age of samples by looking 
at isotope ratios. 

The most useful isotope for dating rock 
samples is uranium-238, which has a half-
life of 4.5 billion years, comparable to the 
age of the Earth. 


Radioactive Dating 


The dating process involves measuring 
the ratio between the parent nucleus and 
the daughter nucleus (lead-206 in the case 
of uranium-238) 



7.4 Surface Activity 
Plate motion is driven by convection 




7.4 Surface Activity 
If we follow the continental drift backwards, the 
continents merge into one, called Pangaea 



7.5 Earth’s Magnetosphere 
The magnetosphere is the region around 
the Earth where charged particles from the 
solar wind are trapped 



7.5 Earth’s Magnetosphere 
These charged particles are trapped in areas 
called the Van Allen belts, where they spiral 
around the magnetic field lines 



7.5 Earth’s Magnetosphere 
Near the poles, the Van Allen belts intersect 
the atmosphere. The charged particles can 
escape; when they do, they create glowing 
light called aurorae. 



7.6 The Tides 
Tides are due to the gravitational force on 
Earth from Moon—force on the near side of 
Earth is greater than the force on far side. 
Water can flow freely in response. 



7.6 The Tides 
The Sun has less 
effect because it 
is farther away, 
but it does 
modify the lunar 
tides 



7.6 The Tides 
Tides tend to exert a “drag” force on the Earth, 
slowing its rotation. 

This will continue until the Earth rotates 
synchronously with the Moon, so that the same 
side of the Earth always points toward the Moon.

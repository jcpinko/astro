Online Lab: <a href="./CometMotion.pdf"> Comet Motion Lab </a>
This lab requires two images of a comet taken at known times.  One of them gives the "plate scale" in arcseconds per pixel.  The other may be at a different scale.  Your job is to analyze the images and figure out the comet's speed in units like degrees/day.
<br>
<br>
Online Lab: <a href="./MoonMtnsAll.pdf"> Mountains on the Moon Lab </a>
This 5-page PDF is a nice activity about measuring the height of a lunar 
mountain.  It requires no data, but it can replace the outdoor lab "Lunar
Surface Features". 
You would make a hardcopy, fill it in, and turn it in.

<p><b>Course Description:</b>
<br>
Astronomy labs requiring math at the algebra level.  These
labs will reinforce the material presented in class (PHY 1051),
including:  the celestial sphere, coordinate systems, motions
of the planets, planetary surface features, lunar surface features, 
moons of planets, and small bodies of the solar system.
<br><br>
PHYS 1081 is the lab associated with the course PHYS 1051, Planetary 
Astronomy.  There is only 1 section, since mainly astronomy minors 
and physics majors with astronomy concentration need to take this lab. 
</p>

<p><b>Lab logistics:</b>
The class time is usually listed as "TBA", so our first job is to
determine good times to meet.  I will send out an email on the
first week to check with you about suggested times.
We will have an informational meeting on the second week 
in which we review the syllabus and you will be assigned your first lab. 
Labs consist of indoor labs (mostly computer-based) and outdoor labs. 
&nbsp; The outdoor labs require a mostly clear sky and will be postponed 
in the case of bad weather.  The indoor labs will primarily be from the 
Virtual Astronomy Labs software which is loaded on various computers in 
the Physics Dept and the Observatory. 

We will do the outdoor labs together at the Observatory,
while the indoor labs are done independently either at the Observatory, 
in the Astronomy Lab (SA 108A), or in the Physics Lounge (SA 116). &nbsp;
<!-- We may need help from the locksmith
for registering your ID card to work as a key to the Science Annex 
rooms after hours. &nbsp;
-->
We will set aside 2 nights a week for outdoor labs, but
we won't go out if cloudy weather is in the forecast. Thus,
on average, we will end up using less than 1 night per week.
You can walk to the observatory, or arrange with me a ride
from the Physics Department.  Let me know your preference.
 </p>

<p><b>Course materials:</b> No textbook required.  Please have a
notebook with neatly detachable paper for working on indoor (VAL) labs.
Clipboards and lights will be provided at the observatory.
Two 3-ring binders containing the instructions
for the Virtual Astronomy Labs will be shared by students.  They
reside in SA 108A.  It is also helpful to have an astronomy
textbook, like the one used in PHYS 1051, for reviewing the
principles being studied.  Old editions can be found in SA 116.

<p><b><font size="+0">Course Policies</font></b>
</p>
<p><i>Attendance</i>&nbsp; is essential for labs. &nbsp;One short period
per week for the daytime meeting and one night a week is 
all that is expected. &nbsp;
An extra night is reserved to make up for cloudy nights,
but some weeks will be completely clouded out.  (This is one
reason why the Outdoor labs are allotted 2 weeks on the schedule.) 
<br>
Most of the lab work will be computer-based labs which
are done outside of class time. </p>
<!--
<p><i>Quizzes & Tests </i>may be given occasionally.&nbsp; They will consist
of multiple choice/short answer questions.  
-->

<p><i>Telescope Certification -> Final/Sky Quiz</i>
You can earn a certificate meaning that you can operate our telescopes
independently.  The certification has two parts: a "sky quiz", and a
telescope operation test.
We may not have time to certify everyone to use the telescopes.
However, we will still have the "sky quiz" portion of certification.
This may consist of an oral exam component (called "sky quiz" in the schedule)
in which you answer questions about the night sky.  
But possibly it will be done as a written Final Quiz.
You should be able to identify at least 7 constellations, and
the 5 brightest objects (stars or planets) visible.&nbsp;
Be able to find the north celestial pole, the zenith, and the celestial
equator.&nbsp; If we don't get a clear night during the last week, I
will test you using a planetarium program.
"Telescope Certification" requires one to set up a telescope 
and acquire targets in the telescope.
</p>
<p><i>Calculators</i>. I encourage you to have a calculator in this
lab.

familiar
with the night sky. (If you ever find yourself
in an astronomy graduate assistantship, you will probably have to find
planets and constellations for undergraduates.)&nbsp; Since

<!--
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Indoor labs</span>: the indoor labs
are usually computer-based.&nbsp; Therefore, you will have the option to
complete the lab at any time, not just the usual meeting time.&nbsp;
However, you should be present at the begining of the Monday meeting time
to get instructions.&nbsp; (The above schedule is VERY tentative - you
can't be assured that the scheduled lab will occur on a given date.)
The due dates for indoor and outdoor labs are ostensibly on 
the day of our short meetings (Mondays), but they can also be turned in
during your instructor's office hours.
</p>
<p><i>Plan an "observing run":</i>&nbsp;use star maps, a celestial
sphere,
or a planetarium program to find interesting objects to observe with a
small (5-inch) telescope.&nbsp; Write out a detailed schedule so that
you
can observe for about 1-2 hours on a clear night during this
quarter.&nbsp;
You must be sure that your object will be accessible at the scheduled
time!

<b> Additional policies </b>
<br>

<i><b> Academic Misconduct </b></i>
<span style="font-size: 0.9em">
In PHYS 1081 (this class), you are encouraged to discuss your
assignments with classmates.  However, you should not copy
each other's work.  There may be some outdoor labs where you
will be using the same data, but do your own calculations and
analysis.  For indoor, "Virtual" labs, each of you should
have different data provided randomly by the computer, so here
it is expected that you have slightly different results.
Both parties may be penalized points for having identical
results for the VAL labs.

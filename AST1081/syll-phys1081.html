&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (Watch here for new, lab-related files.)
<br>

Indoor/Outdoor Lab: <a href="./PlanetSketchesF23.pdf"> Observing the Planets  
PDF. </a>  (In case you need to print out replacement pages.)
<br> <br>
Online Lab: <a href="./MoonMtnsAll.pdf"> Mountains on the Moon Lab </a>
This 5-page PDF is a nice activity about measuring the height of a lunar 
mountain.  It requires no data, but it can replace the outdoor lab "Lunar
Surface Features". 
You would make a hardcopy, fill it in, and turn it in.
<br> <br>

Online Lab: <a href="./CometMotion.pdf"> Comet Motion Lab </a>
This lab requires two images of a comet taken at known times.  One of them gives the "plate scale" in arcseconds per pixel.  The other may be at a different scale.  Your job is to analyze the images and figure out the comet's speed in units like degrees/day.
<br> <br>

<a href="./IMG_2630.JPG"> Comet C/2023 H2 (Lemmon), Pic 1</a>
On Nov 13 the Planetary Lab took this 90 sec exposure with Canon T5i on the Celestron C11. This comet had a very high angular speed of about 18 arcsec/minute.  The green 
color of the coma, caused by C<sub>2</sub> emission, is common in comets.
<br>
<a href="./IMG_2635_2.JPG"> Comet C/2023 H2 (Lemmon), Pic 2</a>
Our final, 547 sec exposure of the comet.  The trail is crooked because the exposure
was unguided and the tracking is imperfect.  North is up and East is left, approximately, so the comet was headed to the southwest.

<p><b>Course Description:</b>
<br>
Astronomy labs requiring math at the algebra level.  These
labs will reinforce the material presented in class (PHYS 1051),
including:  the celestial sphere, coordinate systems, motions
of the planets, planetary surface features, lunar surface features, 
moons of planets, and small bodies of the solar system.
<br><br>
PHYS 1081 is the lab associated with the course PHYS 1051, Planetary 
Astronomy.  There is only 1 section, since mainly astronomy minors 
and physics majors with astronomy concentration need to take this lab. 
Other students can attend the lab with instructor's approval, especially
students who need a science + lab elective, such as Computer Science
majors.
</p>

<p><b>Course Objectives:</b>
<br>
Throughout this course, students will:
<ul>
<li> Obtain knowledge of astronomy, especially concerning the planets, 
	their satellites, comets, asteroids, and
	the appearance of solar system objects 
<li> Develop scientific skills related to astronomy, such as visual
	observing with the naked eye and with telescopes
<li> Gain practice in astronomy related formulas like Kepler's laws and
	the relationship between angular size, actual size, and distance
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Lab logistics:</b>
The class time is usually listed as "TBA" in Course Offerings, so our 
first job is to determine good times to meet.  I will send out an email on the
first week to check with you about suggested times.  You must reply or
you may have to drop the course if the chosen time doesn't fit with your
schedule. <br> <br>
We will have an informational meeting on the second week 
in which we review the syllabus and you will be assigned your first lab. 
Labs consist of indoor labs (mostly computer-based) and outdoor labs. 
&nbsp; The outdoor labs require a mostly clear sky and will be postponed 
in the case of bad weather.  The indoor labs will primarily be from the 
<i> Virtual Astronomy Labs </i> software which is loaded on various computers in 
the Physics Dept and the Observatory. 
We will do the outdoor labs together at the Observatory, the exact time to
be announced in the daytime session on Monday or Tuesday.
The indoor labs are done independently at whichever time is convenient for
the student.  These can be done the Astronomy Lab (SA 108A), or in the 
Physics Lounge (SA 116). &nbsp;
<!-- We may need help from the locksmith
for registering your ID card to work as a key to the Science Annex 
rooms after hours. &nbsp;
-->
<br> <br>
We will reserve 3 nights a week for the outdoor labs and choose whichever
one has the clearest forecast.  (We won't go out if cloudy weather is in the 
forecast.) Some weeks will have no suitable nights for observing. So 
on average, we will end up using less than 1 night per week.
You can walk to the observatory, or arrange with me a ride
from the Physics Department.  Let me know your preference.
 </p>

<p><b>Course materials:</b> No textbook required.  Please have a
notebook with neatly detachable paper for writing up indoor (VAL) labs
and for taking notes.
Clipboards and lights will be provided at the observatory.
Two, 3-ring binders containing the instructions
for the Virtual Astronomy Labs will be kept in SA 108A. 
It is also helpful to have an astronomy
textbook, like the one used in PHYS 1051, for reviewing the
principles being studied.  Old editions can be found in SA 116.

</p>

<p><b>Grading:</b><br>
Your grade will be based primarily on the completion of indoor (computer-based)
and outdoor labs.  The table below shows 10% of the grade based on
telescope certification and sky quiz.  However, 
if weather conditions or other circumstances interfere with the 
telescope certification and sky quiz, the grade may be based 100% on the Labs.
Your goal should be to complete all of the labs and do a thorough job
on the labs.  Most individual labs will be worth 10 points, the exception 
being the first lab "Observing the Planets" which is worth 30 points.

</p>
<p><i>Attendance</i>&nbsp; is essential for labs. &nbsp;One short period
per week for the daytime meeting and one night a week is 
all that is expected. &nbsp;
Two extra nights are reserved to make up for cloudy nights,
but some weeks will be completely clouded out.  (This is one
reason why the Outdoor labs are allotted 2 weeks on the schedule.) 
<br>
Most of the lab work will be computer-based labs which
are done outside of class time. </p>
<!--
<p><i>Quizzes & Tests </i>may be given occasionally.&nbsp; They will consist
of multiple choice/short answer questions.  
-->

<p><i>Access to rooms SA108A, SA116</i>&nbsp; is needed to work on the
"indoor" (computer-based) labs.  We will work with the STM coordinator and
the Physical Plant to arrange for your ID cards to work in the swipe locks.
Have patience since this sometimes takes awhile.  In the meantime, you can
ask faculty in the Physics program to unlock these doors for you during
the hours of approximately 8 to 4:30 pm.  
</p>


<p><i>Telescope Certification and Final/Sky Quiz.</i>
You can earn a telescope certificate, meaning that you can operate our telescopes
independently.  The certification has two parts: a "Sky Quiz", and a
telescope operation test.
We usually do not have time to certify everyone to use the telescopes.
Students who 1) wish to assist in public astronomy events or use the
telescopes for research, 2) are Astronomy minors or Physics majors, and 
3) are younger than seniors will be encouraged to get certified.
Passing the "Sky Quiz" is necessary for certification on a telescope.
The telescope operation test is done outside and one-on-one.
You are required to start up a telescope with an 
equatorial mount (CGE Pro) and acquire targets in that telescope's field of
view.
<br> 
The "Sky Quiz" tests you on knowledge of the sky that is particularly
relevant to telescope operation.  Even if you are not certified, you
may be given the "Sky Quiz".  It will make up no more than 10 percent
of your grade. 
The "Sky Quiz" will probably be given as an outdoor, oral exam.
It might be adapted into a written final quiz, if the instructor sees fit. 
For the Sky Quiz, you should be able to identify at least 7 constellations, and
the 5 brightest objects (stars or planets) visible.&nbsp;
You should be able to describe how the equatorial and altazimuth coordinate
systems work, and you must find the north celestial pole, the zenith, the 
cardinal points, and the celestial equator.&nbsp; 
<!-- If we don't get a clear night during the last week, I
will test you using a planetarium program.
-->
</p>
<p><i>Calculators</i>. I strongly encourage you to have a calculator in this
lab.
</p>
<p><i> Academic Misconduct </i>
In PHYS 1081 (this class), you are encouraged to discuss your
assignments with classmates.  However, you should not copy
each other's work.  There may be some outdoor labs where you
will be using the same data, but do your own calculations and
analysis.  For indoor, "Virtual" labs, each of you should
have different data provided randomly by the computer, so here
it is expected that you have slightly different results.
Both parties may be penalized points for having identical
results for the VAL labs.

The due dates for indoor and outdoor labs are ostensibly on 
the day of our short meetings (Mondays), but they can also be turned in
during your instructor's office hours.
</p>
<p><i>Plan an "observing run":</i>&nbsp;use star maps, a celestial
sphere,
or a planetarium program to find interesting objects to observe with a
small (5-inch) telescope.&nbsp; Write out a detailed schedule so that
you can observe for about 1-2 hours on a clear night during this
quarter.&nbsp;
You must be sure that your object will be accessible at the scheduled
time!

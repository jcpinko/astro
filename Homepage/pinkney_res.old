<P>Jason Pinkney does research on clusters of galaxies.He is interested
in the evolution of galaxies in the cluster environment. Of particular
interest are radio galaxies: to what extent are their properties dependent
on the cluster environment? Pinkney is using kinematic and X-ray analyses
to see whether the clusters containing radio galaxies are dynamically young.
</P>

<P>Pinkney is also using HST to observe supergiant elliptical galaxies
located in <I>cooling flow</I> clusters. The hot gas in these clusters
emit X-rays in such a way to suggest that the inner part of the cluster
is cooling more rapidly than the outer parts, leading to an inflow of gas.
Is the cooling flow responsible for the filaments of dust and emission
found in these ellipticals? </P>

<P>The supergiant elliptical located below center in the picture produces
a <A HREF="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jpinkney/watdef.html">WAT radio
galaxy</A> called <A HREF="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jpinkney/1919.gif">1919+479</A>.
It is centrally located within a poor cluster of galaxies about 1.2 billion
LY away. This CCD image was taken with the Blue Mesa Observatory 24&quot;.

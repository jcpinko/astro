Early-type

<blockquote>My postdoctoral research with Doug Richstone UMich)
involved the search for supermassive black holes in nearby
galaxies.&nbsp;&nbsp; The galaxies must be nearby in order to resolve
the inner most stars of the galaxy which feel the gravitational pull of
the black holes the most.&nbsp; To obtain spectra of these innermost
regions we observed them with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
(STIS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).&nbsp; I reduced the
data for 10 galaxies
and presented them at the Jan 2000 AAS meeting.&nbsp;
These spectra were of nearby early-type galaxies (E's and S0's, the <a
 href="http://www.onu.edu/a+s/physics/GALAXIES/galaxies.html">Hubble
Sequence</a>).&nbsp; Stellar absorption lines from singly ionized
Calcium are prominant in these near-infrared spectra.&nbsp; These lines
were used to measure the stars' losvd
(line-of-sight
velocity distribution) for these galaxies. These losvd's can be used to
deduce the orbits of stars and then the distribution of mass in the
galaxy.
For all 10 of our galaxies, we found a massive dark entity at the
center and the most likely candidate for them is a black
hole (SMBH).
A member of our "Nuker" team, Karl Gebhardt, discovered a correlation
between the mass of this SMBH and the velocity dispersion of the bulge
stars.
  <p>NOVA (and BBC's Horizons) has featured a TV program
about
our research.&nbsp; Here a <a

<blockquote><i><font color="#ff0000"><b>Gas Kinematics.</b> </font></i>The
abovementioned results were derived from stellar kinematics, but I am
also
exploring the use of gas kinematics for measuring BH masses. The gas
is identified by the emission lines it emits.
The gas is collisional, unlike the stars, and so responds to other
forces
besides gravity. The systematic errors one will accrue by assuming a
cold,
disk of gas subject only to gravity are not well known. But I am
working
on several cases that will allow comparison of stellar and gas
kinematics:
NGC 4697, NGC 4258, and NGC 4061.</blockquote>

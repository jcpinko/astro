Substructure in Clusters with Radio Galaxies.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>My interest in radio galaxies in clusters stems from my dissertation
work at NMSU.&nbsp; Radio galaxies like <a href="./watdef.html">WATs</a>&nbsp;
make usefull probes of cluster evolution. Although they are created on very
small scales in AGN, their diffuse tails
extend far into the intracluster medium (ICM) and are presumably shaped
and confined by this hot gas.
<p>X-ray imaging for my dissertation confirmed that extended X-ray emission
exists around WATs.  The X-ray isophotes also show elongations correlating
with the radio tails.
<p>My redshift survey (in press) has shown that the host galaxies of
WATs are nearly at rest with respect to their
subcluster.&nbsp; It also shows that the host clusters of WATs do not
show a significantly higher occurence of substructure.
<p>I am continuing to gather data to discern whether the clusters containing
WATs show systematically more substructure than other clusters.&nbsp; This
might be expected if the bending of the WATs is caused by winds generated
in mergers.&nbsp; Another popular hypothesis is that the winds are generated
by infall along supercluster filaments.

<blockquote>My current postdoc with Doug Richstone involves work with 
Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) data of nearby galaxies.&nbsp;
I have reduced the Cycle 7 data and presented them at the Jan and June
2000 AAS meetings.&nbsp; These spectra were of nearby early-type galaxies 
(E and S0's). The CaII stellar absorption lines are used to measure the stars
losvd's (line-of-sight velocity distributions) for these galaxies. The
first two moments of the losvds are shown below. The NGC numbers are in
green.
<p>The losvd's for these galaxies were analyzed to constrain the orbital
motions of the stars which, in turn, revealed the masses of the central
black holes.  The black hole masses for our 10 galaxies significantly 
contributed to a growing database used to understand the demographics of
supermassive black holes.  It led our team to discover the tight correlation 
between black hole mass and global velocity dispersion (Gebhardt et al. 2000).

X-ray wakes in clusters and the Lx-Lb relation.
<blockquote>
This is a collaboration with UK astronomers Mike
Merrifield, Irini Sakelliou, and Nick Drake.  We have found evidence
for tail-like enhancments around the galaxies in Abell 160.  Combining
this information with photometry from the MDM 1.3-m will allow us to
test the results of wake simulations. Do the brighter galaxies have
stronger wakes?  Do spirals show stronger wakes than ellipticals?
In addition, we can provide low quality, but numerous datapoints
on the Lx-Lb relation.
We hope to find new X-ray wakes using data from the Chandra 
X-ray observatory.

<p><a NAME="4) Substructure in Galaxy Clusters."></a>4) Substructure in
Galaxy Clusters.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>The study of WAT clusters (above) has led into a broader effort
to understand how clusters come together.&nbsp; It looks pretty clear that
heirarchical (bottom-up) merging is the way of the universe, but I would
like to understand some of the details. How fast do subclusters fall together?&nbsp;
How well-defined are `subclusters' in the typical case? How long
does the appearance of substructure last in optical and X-rays? How
can cD peculiar motions constrain the time since merger? And, most interesting,
how does the formation of the cluster influence the properties of the constituent
galaxies?
<p>I am collaborating with Joe Mohr (U. Chicago), Gary Wegner (Dartmouth),
and Tim Beers (Michigan State U.) on an optical substructure survey.&nbsp;
This should help with answering the last question above, and also help
to measure the occurrance rate of substructure. We are performing our own
V and R CCD survey of clusters using the MDM 1.3-m. The sample is half
skewed towards x-ray bright, rich clusters, and half skewed toward low-luminosity
clusters.&nbsp; How will the galaxy populations and substructure differ?
<p>&nbsp;I am collaborating with George Rhee (UNLV) to look for systematic
difference in SOR (Substructure occurance rate) in clusters of different
types (e.g., radio-loud, radio-quiet). With Rhee's student, Sandip Thanki,
we are looking for systematic differences between high and low metallicity
clusters in CCD images.</blockquote>
<a NAME="5) Cooling Flow Ellipticals"></a>5) Cooling Flow Ellipticals
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>In a postdoc with J. Holtzman, I used HST to observe supergiant
elliptical galaxies located in <i>cooling flow</i> clusters. The hot gas
in these clusters emit X-rays in such a way to suggest that the inner part
of the cluster is cooling more rapidly than the outer parts, leading to
an inflow of gas. Is the cooling flow responsible for the filaments of
dust and emission found in these ellipticals?  Probably not, because
some clusters (A2029) have a cooling flow but no filaments.  On the
other hand, no clusters with strong central Halpha lack a cooling
flow, so a CF is probably a necessary but insufficient condition. 
Much of my work measuring the mass of dust in these systems is 
unpublished.</blockquote>

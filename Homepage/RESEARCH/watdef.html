<p>WAT stands for "wide-angle-tailed" radio galaxy. These beasts
are associated with supergiant (sometimes cD) galaxies in clusters of
galaxies.
Their radio power is intermediate between FRI and FRII sources. Their
appearance
in radio maps is characterized by a bright core producing two,
well-collimated
jets which disrupt at hot-spots into more diffuse "tails". The
tails show slight bending - not as extreme as the HT (head-tail) or NAT
(narrow-angle tailed) varieties. The tails and jets emit radio waves by
synchrotron radiation - electrons and protons spiraling around magnetic
fields.</p>
<p>Below is a collection of WATs imaged by the VLA at 20cm from a paper
by O'Donoghue et al.</p>
